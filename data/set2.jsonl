Im in Asheville N.C. what can/should I do !?His understand your concern. Chronic pain can be treated with different modalities. Management is depended upon site of pain. Minor surgical correction in nerve root supply will decrease pain if site is accessible to surgery. For that you have to consult pain specialist. Medicines like TCA can be beneficial. Amitriptyline or bothering is choice in chronic pain. Avoid methadone as it is opioid derivatives and highly addictive. Underlying psychological stress and its assessment also give good results. Consult psychiatrist and pain specialist for better assistance. I hope I have answered you query. Happy to help you further. Thank you.",
        "I m a 48 year old lady having problem from last 8month neuropathic pain in my Calf & surrounding ankle.from last 2 month I m suffering urine problem I have to go toilet 3-4times in night.I m a patient of o/A having Glucsamin calcium multivitamin omega From last 5years.My pain in toe fingers & Ankle from last 8 month kindly suggest me the right way of treatment to get result.I will be highly thankful to youHello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor Psychiatry from India. I can understand your concern. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your query. I have carefully read your question and could understand that you are suffering from osteoarthritis and neuropathic pain. Firstly let me educate you about various available medicines for pain. Pain is a noxious stimulus which should be managed promptly. Nowadays pain management is done through a multidisciplinary approach which includes physician, surgeon, anesthetist and psychiatrist. If pain is recurring and simple painkillers like NSAIDs are ineffective then some alternatives should be tried. There are few medicines which act locally like pain relief gels and sprays. Some newer oral medicines act at spinal cord and brain level and reduce the perception of pain. Some medicines contain combination of an analgesic and an opioid. Some refractory cases required nerve block. Now coming to your case, since you are having chronic pain of osteoarthritis and neuropathy, you need regular medicine. Common painkiller NSAIDs may be dangerous as they may cause peptic ulcer and renal complications. Opioid medication may be addicting. Hence, you need something with little side effect. If a lady like you comes to my clinic, I suggest them to relax and try some De-stressing measures. Because stress and anxiety increases the perception of pain. These distressing activities are:-- healthy balance diet-regular exercise, yoga, meditation & relaxation exercise-adequate rest and sleep-listening soothing slow relaxing music etc. If needed I prescribe them some medicines like Pregabalin and Nortriptyline in combination along with methylcobalamin and folic acid. These medicines act on spinal cord and brain pain pathways and are relatively safer for long term use. Results in clinical settings are rewarding. You may discuss these issues with your doctor. Hope I have given you a way. I wish you all the best.",
        "I seem to be very resistant to painkillers, my latest is tramadol, I ve been on it for 3 days and for sure can feel it s side effects but as per usual it s not helped the pain. I got given two weeks work but my doctor said by 3 days I should know of it will help with the pain or not. It s not touched the pain. What would the next painkiller to try? I ve been on cocodamol, codydramol, amytriptaline, naproxen, zapain and tramadol. I am worried about going on more opiates since I go back to University I m September need tone able to cognitively function but also be in as little pain as possible. Thank you.As per your explanation. I understand you are in pain. But why you are in pain?, what problem you have ? Since when you are having this problem and pain related to this ? Since when you know your body is resistance with painkiller ? Need to know all above things. Which you have not mentioned. So here I am giving you general guideline. Treat the cause of pain not the symptoms. As well do regular exercise, take good sleep, have balance diet and keep a positive attitude. These four things will help you I believe in your life to fight against the pain better way then just taking a painkiller.  Apart from this for localize pain you can also use hot and cold pack to have some more relaxing and anti-inflammatory effects. In your diet remember to keep more of omega 3 because it's a natural anti-inflammatory and helps for many other problems in our body. Hope this was useful for you. Ask your question again if needed. Take care.",
        "Hello, 33 female I weigh 145 and am told i have good blood pressure. I have four children. Constant daily head pain above right temple for 4 years. Thought was tooth infection or chronic sinusitis, but had tooth pulled a year ago with only worsening of pain since then. No stuffy nose ever. But last 6 months chest pain and left middle to lower stomach pain have added to my daily list. Doctors have done MRIs ,Cat scans, and told me also to pick a symptom.Hi, I cannot say in your particular case, but generally, pains in vastly different parts of the body are not going to have the same physiology. The location and movement of a pain gives clues as to what is going on. Also, if pain were from an organ dysfunction, generally there are other signs. Psychological underpinnings of pain can be tricky and people do not want to miss an organ malfunctioning. On, the other hand, if organ malfunctioning does not seem to be occurring--and this should be monitored periodically--then coping skills for pain would overlap completely with psychological causes. One does not have to know the cause of pain to work on it. CBT and antidepressants with pain efficacy (amitriptyline) are one option. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

        "Post surgery for squamous skin cell cancer on the thigh, just above the knee. Surgery was 1 week ago. Today the site smells strongly like yeast. It seems to be very sore and getting sorer. There seemed to be a hot reaction to polysporin 5 days ago, so for the last 3 days we have used only vasoline to keep it lubed. The pathology report says the margins are good and the stitches will be removed in about another week.Hi, Thanks for writing in. Wound healing after surgery depends on care taken following surgery. It is important to talk to your doctor regarding addition of a good oral antibiotic to control any infection that might have started at the surgery site. Surgery has been done properly, and the cancer is removed. However, there can always be a focus of infection that has started after surgery and this can be due to many causes including multiplication of bacteria which has entered through the stitches. As polypoid is causing reaction, you must immediately add another oral antibiotic which is recommended by your doctor. This will stabilize the bacterial infection and reduce the soreness. Anti-inflammatory pills are also to be taken to reduce inflammation and for better healing. Please do no worry.",

        "Hello...I was in a hurry not informed about my suturing set sterility( it was not sterile) and i sutured a patient s wound of about 10 cm with a suturing set used before without being sterilized and only washed ( very good washed) with water.Without any information about the viral markers profile of previously sutured patients by this set or other sets( where used sets are washed together). In summary i sutured a wound 10 cm length with a well washed but not sterilized suturing set. My question is that beside the probability of later wound infection is there a risk for HIV, HBsAg, HCV contamination of that person? ( the wound was perfectly cleansed and washed perfectly by betadine before suturing)Hello, THX to contact us. If I am your treating doctor I would like to advice you that before how much time you have sutured previous patient. If you have sutured the previous patient within 15 minutes there are chances to transfer HIV, Bag, HCV from previous patients to these patients. Also do not forget even though you have washed it and the viruses you have mentioned may be washed of with water, but there are chances that Clostridium retain may get involved in the wound which you have sutured. Clostridium retain is convert into highly resistant spore form and not get washed with the water. If you have anything else to ask please contact me. Than. Chat Doctor",
        "Went to a thai massage parlour. Got massage on genitals. While massaging near groin, got a cut as long as 2cm on skin. She used massage oil. She did repeeatedly massage the wound area and had fingernail contact on it few times again. Is there anything to worry about?Hi there, and thank you for your question. I appreciate your concern regarding this matter and I'll try to help where I can. If one sustains a superficial scratch on the skin, then you should look out for signs of infection at around the third day after the injury. These signs include redness around the site of the wound, pus discharging from the wound itself or generalized fever experienced by the patient. If you start to notice these signs, then I would suggest that you see your doctor as soon as you can so that they may prescribe the appropriate treatment for this issue. In order to prevent an infection from occurring you can continue with the following care. You can clean the wound with a saline solution (salt water) 3 times a day until the wound has made a scab over it. You can then let the area granulate on its own. I hope this helps and good luck."

There s no where else to turn here:(Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I can understand your feelings and emotions. But you should realize the reality with the mental disorder concept. The more you worry about your mental disorder (whatever it is) the more it will trouble you. I also understand, how troublesome the problem is. But, there is no alternative to manage it. You were consulting a psychiatrist for 12 years and just last year you were diagnosed bipolar. That seems to be peculiar. But naming a mental disorder is just for prescribing medicines. Psychologists and therapists approach the mental disorder in a different angle, and they provide you with psychotherapy methods to manage your disorder. Awareness is the first step to manage your disorder. You should be aware of your symptoms, frequency, type, how it disturbs you, whole pattern of the symptoms etc. once you how and when the symptoms come, you can easily put diversions. Therefore, as the first step of therapy process, I suggest you to maintain a diary about everything from your thoughts and emotions and behaviors and symptoms. Be systematic. Continue writing this cognitive diary for a month and then with the diary visit a psychologist and rest of the therapy will be provided by the therapist. Don't worry. Management will be as effective as cure. Smile now. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute detail possible.

Is this ok? I also lost 15 pounds and am now 105 pounds. Oh, and Im 50yrs. old.Hello, Few strategies to reduce the stress and I hope once you follow these things you will ace to overcome stress1. Diet: Ensure intake of an adequate quantity of fiber. 2. Servings of vegetable salad and two servings of fruits (One preferable citrus fruit). A proper diet does miracles and rejuvenates. Orange is a good source of anti-oxidants. Avoid junk food and fast food especially pizza, burgers and excessive sweets.2. Ensure adequate water intake: Follow the rule of one which I usually advise. One glass of water one hour before and one glass of water one hour after every meal will ensure adequate consumption of water. The recommended intake of water is two to three-liter in a day.3. Early morning Exercise: Brisk walking for 30 minutes at a stretch preferably in the garden will be very helpful. Walking is the best exercise, it also promotes the release of endorphins (naturally occurring painkillers released in the brain) which causes mood elevation and a generalized feeling of well-being.4. Avoid tea or coffee or nicotine and alcoholic beverages5. Start your day with a glass of lemon water with two spoons of honey added.6. Don't take work so seriously: We all have the feeling to excel in our respective fields and don't spend adequate time with our self trying to understand our own needs. Spend time with your family and friends.7. While working takes frequent regular breaks: Taking regular breaks will not waste the time, but it will increase productivity, concentration, and reasoning.8. Avoid late-night socialization9. Avoid starring for a longer time at the computer screen or TV for a longer time10. Steam inhalation before going to sleep will be very refreshing.11. Multivitamin and calcium supplement.

It can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) and enlargement of the spleen and in your case due to poor appetite the child has lost weight, which he is likely to regain once he starts recuperating.

        "Hi! I was diagnosed with mono about 4 weeks ago, but I have had it since January. I have had good days to where I can get out of the house and other days to where I wont have an appetite or get out of bed! I was reading some info about chronic mono and was wondering if I could have it?Hello, I understand your concern. Most cases of mononucleosis, mono, are caused by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (ABV) and get it only once. Sometimes mononucleosis symptoms may recur months or even years later. Once you're infected with ABV, you carry the virus for the rest of your life. The virus may reactivate off and on.  The virus can then be detected in the saliva, but one does not usually become ill. In mono one often has a general feeling of malaise, starting with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, headache and sore throat. Your main symptoms are lack of appetite and lack of energy and these are not likely to be the cause of Mono. I think you should see an Internist and have your condition investigated and diagnosed.",

Thank you for consulting with Chat Doctor ! Infectious Mononucleosis is caused by a virus (Epstein Barr Virus).  Among child Chat Doctor.  The symptoms are fever, sore throat, fatigue and generalized lymphadenopathy- which means enlarged lymph nodes. Patients may also complain of headache and body pain like in other viral infections. On examination, there's enlargement of the spleen and liver such as that seen in your son. Did your doctor do any test to confirm that its Infectious Mononucleosis? Although the symptoms are pointing at it. There's no specific treatment for this. Its mostly supportive, fever medicine and rest. It is best for your child to avoid strenuous activities in the next 2-3 weeks while splenomegaly is still present. We want to avoid any trauma that can cause the spleen to rupture. Hope I was able to help you. Have a good day! Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D.",

I dont think the doctor checked her blood, I think it was that fast test.Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Infectious mononucleosis is also called as \"kissing disease\" and glandular fever which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (ABV). Infectious mononucleosis is a contagious illness and the infection can be spread by saliva and the incubation period is four to eight weeks. This can be diagnosed by blood tests. People who have this disease continue to shed virus particles in their saliva throughout their lifetime. This can be best treated with antibiotics like penicillin or erythromycin and NSAIDs can be given for fever, headache and body ache. Thank you."

        "Hi Doctor, My daughter is 3.5 Years old. She is complaining stomach ache some times. We have given Rantac and Bifilac sachet for 5 days. After stopping the medication, she is complaining stomach ache again. Please suggest. regards, NarendraWelcome to the Chat Doctor I completely understand your concerns but don't worry. If the stomach pain is central and not associated with any other symptoms such as fever, jaundice, vomiting, bowel or bladder dysfunction, then it is not likely to be benign. Toddlers are prone to abdominal pains especially due to gut infestation by parasites. I usually recommend to deform the child with Single dose of Albendazole and repeat dose after 15 days. Along with this give healthy diet with lots of fluids especially water. Avoid spicy and oily food for the time being including fast foods. Hopefully this will help. In case the pain is associated with any of the above-mentioned symptoms, then a proper clinical examination by pediatrician will help. For any further questions, you may contact me. Take care",
        "My daughter is 7 and was sent home from school today due to feeling faint, shaking and was drinking alot of water. She fainted at end of January 2011 and has been suffering tummy pains since xmas. Is there something underlying that is causing these symptoms? Urine test done and was clear in Jan 2011.Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. It is imperative to undergo multiple tests in case of pain in abdomen of a child of 7 years as she may give a proper and detailed history. I would advise her the following::-MRI of the brain as she had a history of fainting in January 2011.-Ultrasonography and complete hologram, and stool test. -Clinical / Physical examination by a Pediatric Surgeon as an expert opinion and advise you a proper treatment, investigations and get an appropriate diagnosis.-Get a course of proper antibiotic, metronidazole, anthelmintic. The causes of pain in abdomen in a child are as follows:The most probable cause of pain in a child -Tummy tonsils-meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms. The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. Some blood, urine and stool tests. A therapeutic trial with a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotics under the guidance of a pediatrician / Surgeon always helps to solve the problem and to get a diagnosis. Also given is a dose of medicines active against worms in intestine.",

Not sure if it s time to see her pediatricianIf there is no any other complaints like fever, bowel disturbances, urinary symptoms etc. associated with stomach pain and if your child has stomach pain which subsides by itself within few minutes and does require any medication for same then it is likely functional (no significant internal abnormality) pain. U should see a pediatrician who will examine your children abdomen and can tell u if he needs any investigations or not. The other two symptoms does look related to stomach pain. Those two symptoms headache and increased sleep during day time may be due to improper sleep at night. U should see a pediatrician as it will help decrease your anxiety.",
        "My son is in the hosp with severe abdominal pain. He is eight yrs old. His pain is being treated with morphine 2mg iv every 4 hrs prn as needed. They are saying it is a stomach virus, but he is hurting in his legs, chest and bilateral lower stomach. he is running a temp of 103. he is yelling out when pain starts until morphine kicks in.Hi. Thanks for your query. The commonest causes for severe pain in abdomen in a child of 8 years old are to be ruled out by investigations:Blood-CBC, Tidal, Urine -routine, microscopy, culture and sensitivity.Stool-Routine and microscopy, Culture and sensitivity if loose stools. Ultrasonography of the abdomen. A consultation with the Pediatric Surgeon is a must as it helps for better diagnosis. A course of an antibiotic and metronidazole with intravenous fluids should help, and the further treatment will depend upon the findings of the reports and a definite treatment can be carried out. Appendicitis, lymph node mass, pyelonephritis are a few common causes. Stomach flu is said to be a reason only if all the investigations are normal and an occasional cause like abdominal epilepsy has to be borne in mind. Morphine should be avoided as much as possible. If the child is needing Morphine there is more than the stomach flu."

Worm infestations can be cured by taking single adult dose of Albendazole, which is a broad spectrum anti-helmenthic Chat Doctor.  To be more effective, you can repeat the dose again after a week or ten days, after taking the first dose. This would be effective in most cases to eradicate the worms from the intestines.

They are usually identified by the animals they come from - for example, Tania Saginaw from beef, Tania sodium from pork, and Diphyllobothrium datum from fish. To diagnose a tapeworm infection, the following needs to be done:1. Stool sample analysis by microscopic identification for eggs or tapeworm segments. It may require 2 to 3 stool analysis done regularly to look for the tapeworm infestation. 2. Blood test to detect antibodies your body may have produced to fight tapeworm infection. 3. Imaging studies such as CT or MRI scans, X-rays, or ultrasounds of cysts, may suggest invasive tapeworm infection. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",
        "I was diagnosed with a parasitic disease approx. 7 years ago and received medications. I am currently having almost identical symptoms. The cysts associated with this disease remained somewhat the same for the past 7 years but otherwise I felt better. I have no colon due to total colectomy so I use catherization with the highest regard to cleanliness etc. I cannot find a doctor who will repeat testing to see if I have a different type of issue. GI doctor only detects ostomy related problems due to the age of my Koch pouch. I have looked for months for someone that uses a parasitology lab and is experienced in this field with no avail. I have lost about 40 lbs and am pretty ill. Thank yu for any assistance.Thank you for your query! I can help you to diagnose the worm and guide treatment if you can name the cyst that was identified earlier. What are your symptoms? He? Get your stool examined for routine microscopy. You can give a try to Albendazole 400 mg one dose orally is the Chat Doctor. If you are passing worm then you can collect it show it to your local doctor for identification. Take vitamin A supplementation with healthy diet. Take care!",
        "My family member has been sick for 2 years with various symptoms. These symptoms including weight loss, limb tingling/ numbness, Nausea, passing of undigested food frequently throughout the day, fatigue and severe back and pelvis pain have all progressively worsened over the course of 2 years.

Usually most of the parasites are in gut, and they stay in gut canal, some of them like malaria will stay in lymphatics. For one type of parasite the entry is through skin but till now no parasite found that exits through skin.May be your friend is correct, but it might not be parasite. It could be some skin infection like psoriasis in which there skin becomes Chat Doctor. Get a blood and stool microscopy that will show any parasites.

        "I walked in very light clothes a few days ago in a really cold temperature. Now I have swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and I sweat whenever i sleep. Is it possible that its from the cold? That same night I had unprotected sex and I looked at the symptoms for HIV and they are exactly like mine. But most of the sites say that symptoms usually take 2-4 weeks. Could this be a coincidence or are they symptoms of HIV?Hello! I have been through your question. You should know that many people with HIV have no symptoms for several years, others may develop symptoms similar to flu, usually two to six weeks after catching the HIV. Related your concern, and based on your data, having unprotected sex few days ago, the good news for the moment is that I think is more possible to have these symptoms for other reasons (viral or bacterial), and not the primary HIV infection, even they are similar. But just in case to be sure for this, because a higher risk exist after an unprotected sex, I suggest to talk with an Infection Diseases specialist, do a physical examination and to see in detail your symptoms (like how many, tender and bigger are your lymph nodes, their locations) and, full blood count and to do a rapid test or Elisa for HIV (after three weeks of your last unprotected sex, and as well after three months to exclude better the HIV infection). Also, you should be aware that after infection with HIV, it can take up from three weeks to three months for the virus to show up in testing and retesting may be necessary. I hope my answer help you. I wish you a quick recovery.",

I am glad we connected. HIV and AIDS usually takes a few years to develop. This is when the immunity level is low enough for the symptoms to show up. This is when one can observe the symptoms that you have mentioned. It would be a good idea get an HIV test done at 4 weeks and then repeat after 3 months. This would allow one to pick up the virus and determine if one has HIV. Do let me know what the doctor says. I hope this helps. All the best.",

If had protected intercourse then the chance of transmission of HIV is very small. If you wish to be sure that you do not have HIV, then you would need to do testing. This would be the only reliable way to determine if HIV is present. You may also want to consider a full blood count and ESR test. This would determine if you have anemia. The ESR is increased when there is any inflammation in the body which can occur from infection, inflammation, injury, cancer, autoimmune diseases. I hope this helps"

Any ideas???Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Lyme disease is a bacterial disease which is transmitted to humans by the bite of ticks carrying a bacterium known as Cordelia burgdorferi. The initial infection can occur with minimal or no symptoms. But many people experience a flu like illness and a characteristic rash several days to a few weeks following a tick bite. The rash is a red rash that grows in size daily. It is called erythema migrant. Rash is a skin lesion that typically begins as a red spot and expands over a period of days to weeks to form a large round lesion of at least 5 cm. Its shape can be circular or oval. It can be confirmed by performing blood tests to examine for antibodies to the bacteria. Thank you",

I m not sure the rash and other systems are related. could I have a late onset lymes disease, since I was bite by a tick in Kansas several months ago?Hi, Many types of tick bites and tick fevers can cause a rash. The exact nature of the rash varies based on the type of the tick. Some types of patterns seen are target-shaped lesions, bumpy rash, vacuoles. However, when one uses a steroid or lotion, the type of rash may change because the symptoms have reduced as the histamine that causes rash would not produce a full-fledged rash. It is possible for the rash to be a tick fever or tick-related disease, but this cannot be confirmed without tests. Do see your doctor get the immunoglobulin levels for tick fever or general Immunoglobulin levels tested.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

I would advise you not to worry so much as the doctor might have evaluated the patient. You must give him paracetamol or Advil, tepid sponging and if itching then cetirizine. Monitor temperature. Get routine mammogram and serological test for tick borne fever. Depending upon the results antibiotics may be started. Hope I answered your query Chat Doctor. "

        "I have paranoid schizophrenia. I have been receiving antipsychotics and a drug for depression and drugs for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Thirty years ago I noticed a bulls eye rash on my stomach. It went away in a few days so I did not tell my doctor about it. Now I realize that this could be \"Lyme\" disease which went undiagnosed and untreated. I plan to tell my doctor this. What are the long term untreated symptoms of Lyme disease and how would it be detected and treated. Can you shed some advice that would help me after all these years?Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Lymes disease is caused by a spirochete called Cordelia burgdoferi which usually is spread by tick bites. The typical presentation would be a rash at the site of bite. This is the first stage. The second stage presents with fever and body pain, headaches, joint pains and lymph node swelling. This occurs after few weeks after first stage. The third stage is stage of persistent infection where there are symptoms of arthritis, dermatitis and neuropathy. Clinical diagnosis is missed as it is a slow disease. Lab diagnosis is by serological tests like ELISA and Immunofluorescence for Egg antibodies. Rising title indicates active infection. Treatment is by Doxycycline, Amoxicillin, Cefuroxime. Hope I have cleared your doubts. Thanks.",

I do not have the bulls eye rash or any other symptoms I have read about for Lyme except that off and on recently random joints hurt for a day then feel fine. Should I get checked for Lyme disease?Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Lymes disease when progresses to chronic stage it usually presents with joint pain, lethargy, generalized weakness, dermatitis and can be depressing to some extent. Try to divert your mind from your symptoms by keeping in touch with friends and family and keeping yourself busy throughout the day. Lyme disease has early signs and symptoms and later signs and symptoms. The early once appear within a month and include rash on the place where you have been bitten and flu like symptoms. So if you've been bitten and experience signs and symptoms of Lyme disease, contact your doctor immediately. Treatment for Lyme disease is most effective if begun early. However, diagnosis can be confirmed by ELISA for Egg against Cordelia and can be confirmed by a western blot test. Thank you.",

I would like to inform you that yes Lyme disease can cause all these symptoms such as extreme fatigue, headache, stiffness of neck, joint and muscle pain. So in my opinion you discuss about this with your physician as soon as possible because at an early stage it can né managed very easily with antibiotics. If left untreated this may cause more troubles such as may affect heart and nerves also. Hope this will help you dear.  If you have any other concerns please feel free to message me.

Today I woke up with congestion (even though I can breathe through my nose) and Im very tired.  Is this allergies or a cold brewing?  Been taking zinc just in caseHello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions for you:1. If you have these symptoms occasionally only, I would suggest you not to worry about allergy (maybe an infection or an irritating reaction to something like smoke, strong smell, fumes, or any other irritant) or even they are seasonal, you may have seasonal allergies only.2. If you have such symptoms often or repeatedly, you may have allergic causes. In that case, I would suggest you an allergy evaluation by an Allergist.3.

Plenty of warm fluids during the days as well as adequate rest will also help you.5. Usually zinc does not cause such symptoms, so I would suggest you not to worry about zinc.

        "Hi Doctor, My son is 8 months old. He is having frequent bowel movements but normal. My doctor prescribed zinconia 1ml 2 times a day. My son is normal in his activities. His stools are also normal. Normal in color and ador. Please suggest. I am so much worried.Hi...nothing needs to be done. You need not worry unless he is exhausted/ not passing urine/ there is blood in the motion/ abdominal distension/ listless. I suggest you give him plenty of oral fluids, avoid aerated Chat Doctor.  But the zinc supplements you are giving him is not adequate. Zirconia syrup contains 20 mg of zinc in 5ml, and you need to give 5ml once a day and not 1ml twice a day. He will get better soon. If he develops any of the danger signs mentioned above, kindly consult your pediatrician. Regards - "

        "i heard about pomelos being good for high blood pressure , UTIs esp. in pregnant women. i also heard that Cranberry juice thins the blood...... this suggests to me that a life-long healthy diet will prevent health problems from starting. And drugs for each problem are derived from the foods / vitamins / minerals that the patient is actually avoiding. would you agree with my conclusion. I have no science or healthcare education or qualification.Hello! Ofcourse Healthy and balanced diet is important for life. No doubt, it is better to prevent a disease rather than consuming energy and money on cure. Here are some facts you want to know... Pomposity is citrus fruits containing abundant of vitamin C that enhances your immunity, besides that it is rich in fibers, bioflavonoids (protects from cancers) and minerals (regulate blood pressure). Cranberry juice It contains substances that may affect your health, for example antioxidants help body to prevent cancer development. It also prevents bacterial growth in urinary tract and may benefit in Otis. Beside all this excessive use may decay your teeth and oxalate in juice may lead to kidney stones. In short, proper use of healthy and balanced diet with regular exercise is the best way to a happy life. Take Care!",
        "my father has been collapsing due to his irregular heart and after a mini stroke and heart attack they said they are putting him on morfrin (not sure how to spell) they also say he needs to change his diet- where can we get ideas of what to eat as told not to eat tomany greens and cereal which he lovesHi . Thanks for choosing us for your health query. Your father recovering from minor stroke. But if you had mentioned the co morbid conditions it should have helped us to guide you more accurately. Any way with an assumption that he has diabetes, hypertension and stroke I will guide for a healthy diet and lifestyle. You need to calculate the calories in your father food limit his calorie intake to 1800 because is a sedentary male. Of the calories you need to give 800 calories in morning and 500 for noon and night. If his kidneys are fine we need not restrict on the protein give 1gm/ kg body weight. Control his oil intake to 4 teaspoons per day because he had stroke high lipids are basic cause. Take care of hidden fat also that present in groundnut, coconut etc. If kidneys are fine we do not need to cut his veggie intake. If he is a diabetic and is under control you can give two portions of cut fruits 100gm each. Hope our suggestion helps. Take care",

He has cut out all ice cream and no cookies now for the past month. How long will it take for his levels to go down and how else can I help him?Hi I did review your concern. Apart from diet regimes I would recommend regular aerobic exercise to decrease central obesity and decrease triglyceride levels.Also, if the triglycerides still remain high you should consult your doctor and start treatment with statins and vibrates to decrease triglycerides, the fall in triglycerides with regular diet and exercise occurs in 1-2 months.I hope this helps.

I dont smoke but drink a good wine at least every other weekend.  We consider ourselves a very healthy family since we dont fry anything, we dont eat fast food out and we are all very active.  What could be the cause of this elevated levels?Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Yes, your triglycerides are high. 2. Difficult to identify the cause, but it is only slightly elevated. It could be alcohol. Alcohol commonly raises triglycerides.3. Check for triglycerides again after a month. If high, you can try taking vibrates or niacin to help in triglyceride control. Include more omega 3-fatty acids in diet. Avoid alcohol. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.",

Like what does this mean?Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your triglycerides level is slightly high.  However, your HDL cholesterol level is very low. HDL is a good cholesterol.  It is protective in heart disease. Low HDL is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. You should take low fat diet with high amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Repeat your cholesterol level after a month.

        "I had TURP 3 months ago due to BPH. My situation is only a little better but not good enough. Still have to urinate about once an hour(before TURP it was every half hour) and flow is weak. Also, very little urine comes out and I find myself pushing to get the last drops out. Most of the time I feel that I emptied out after urinating but sometimes during the day I have the discomfort associated with not feeling empty. I sleep almost all night without having to go during the night but that was true before the surgery as well. Actually, I was doing better a month ago than now and that is my major concern. Is this all the normal recovery process and can I expect for things to improve as time goes on, or after 3 months should I be in a better place? Should I wait before returning to my urologist? In general I would say that the improvement since TURP is only marginal. ThanksHelloThanks for query. You have difficulty in passing urine and frequency for urination even after three months of TURN surgery for enlarged prostate. This could be either narrowing of urethral passage (Stricture Urethra) which is common after TURN or second possibility of persistent UTI. Please get your routine Urine test and urine culture done to rule out infection. Visit your Urologist and discuss with him regarding doing endoscopic examination of urethra and bladder (Cystoscopy) . If needed he may do endoscopic dilatation of urethral passage (VIA)during the same sitting. This will resolve your problem. Chat Doctor. ",

I have no burning or pain.HelloThanks for query Absence of burning or pain while urination with only urgency for urination is mostly due to what is called as Over Active Bladder (OAB). Normally one gets sensation of urge to pass urine after bladder gets filled up with 200-250 ml of urine, however in OAB there are involuntary contraction of bladder even when it is filled with just 30 -40 ml of urine resulting into Urgency and passing a small quantity of urine.

        "I have had a prostrate problem for over two years.  My local hospital prescribed dutesturide and tamsulosin about two years ago and I do not think it has made much difference.  I just believe that I am becoming accustomed to the problems and in the main control it myself.  I consulted my doctor who has referred me back to the hospital where I am going to ask for the operation to get my normal flow back.  They did previously say there is a risk in this.  Can you tell me about the risks or is there a stronger medication that I can take in its stead to get me back to something like normal?  My age is 70 and in most other areas am fit and well for my age.Thank you.Tithe maximal amount of medications that can be given has already been given to you and the next step would be operation called TURN. The main risks during operation are bleeding and infection and risk of giving spinal anesthesia as for any other operation. After surgery again there is bleeding risk, risk of urine infections, risk of loosing erections in 10% of patients, formation of scar tissue in 1 in 10 patients requiring reoperation. 2 out of 10 patients may require another TURN operation in 10 years Overall the complication rates are low unless you have other medical problems that can increase risk of an anesthetic.",

I am 52 years old.Respected user, hi I evaluated your query thoroughly.* Any minor / major surgery is having risk to some more or less extent for any person.* As the surgery type is major and associated co morbid conditions present are more, in your case you have more risk than other person for the same surgery.  - Outcome in terms of success and complications are to be evaluated combined by expert Anesthetic doctor & operating Surgeon.  - Ultimately it is the evaluation of need of surgery depending upon the symptoms & severity assessment by parameters versus possible risks involved in & after the procedure.* My personal recommendations for you If much symptomatic & bothering issue for you, take all risks and go for surgery ; if not much problematic in day to day life don't take risk as doctors are pressurizing. Hope this helps you. Welcome for any further assistance. Thanks for using Chat Doctor .com & giving me an opportunity to assistWishing you fine health ahead. Regards dear take care.",
        "sir recently my father is diagnosed with throat cancer by that time doctor said its in the third stage ..... my father is 73 years old... no other health problems like bp , sugar heart attack ... is there any affects if my father go with operation at this age almost all tests had been done for operation iam in dillemma pls give me ur valuable opinionHi, Thanks for the query. According to what you have said, your father is not having any other chronic disorders. Before surgery, pre-operative investigations would be done. As you have mentioned that those have been done, and if the test reports were pretty normal, it would not harm to undergo the surgery. As for the side effects of surgery, it depends on the type and extent of the surgery involved. Hope I have answered your query. If any further clarification is required, please feel free to ask. Thank you.",
        "sir my son has hypertrophy turbinates one or the other side will always be blocked. if we go for sugery they say if turbinates are operated polluted air and all viruses affect the lungs. is that true?which surgery better laser or radio .....idont knowThanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No this is not true. Removal of turbinates can not allow viruses or polluted air to go inside the lungs. So don't believe in this. Hypertrophied turbinates are the common cause for blocked nose in child Chat Doctor.  They actually cause mechanical obstruction. And hence surgery is must overcome this mechanical obstruction. Laser surgeries are better than radio surgeries. Laser surgeries are safer, and they give faster recovery time. So in hospital stay is less, and hence cost is also reduced. So better to go for laser surgery for Hypertrophied turbinates. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks."

I can understand your concern. Polymyositis is connective tissue disease. It affects almost all organs of the body especially lungs. It is incurable and progressive disease. With treatment, we can reduce the rate of progression, but we can revert it. Pulmonary fibrosis in Polymyositis patients suggest worse prognosis. Usual life expectancy after diagnosing fibrosis is less than 4 years. So this disease usually get worse over time. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Thanks.",

Myositis ossifies develops some time after a contusion or blow to a muscle usually in the thigh. Symptoms of Myositis ossifies include pain in the muscle particularly during exercise.  An X-ray can confirm the diagnosis and show bone growth; sometimes biopsy needed! An X-ray of the muscle can be done to see when it is safe to start rehabilitation and strengthening exercises. In particularly severe cases surgery can be performed to remove the bone growth. Hope this answers your question.

    "question": "What are the causes, symptoms, and treatments associated with cold sores, and how do they typically affect individuals across different age groups and circumstances?\nBetter give me some examples.",
    "answer": "Cold sores are caused by the herpes virus which is related to the chicken pox virus that causes shingles. \n\nSymptoms can vary from one person to the next, but in most cases, symptoms are limited to the area where the sores are located. However, in some cases, the symptoms can be systemic.\n\nIn one case, a 62-year-old woman suffered from cold sore virus outbreaks, which made her ill, and she also had shingles. She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which she believed was made worse by the cold sore virus.\n\nAnother case involved a person who had hsv-1 and was prone to oral cold sores since they were a child. They started taking Microgestin birth control pills and noticed that they got cold sores more frequently.\n\nCold sores can be caused by trauma, physical or chemical. In this case, the person was advised to plan for other methods of contraception.\n\nIn another case, a person had a history of cold sores and was dealing with an outbreak. They believed there was an infection because their lip and glands under their chin were swollen, and the sore was not healing quickly.\n\nThe severity of cold sore symptoms can depend on the severity of the infection and the individual's immunity. In some cases, the infection can occur with higher severity when the body's immunity is reduced.\n\nAntibiotics will not help with a viral infection like cold sores. In one case, a person was prescribed an antibiotic by their doctor, but it was not effective in treating the infection.\n\nCold sores are a communicable disease, and individuals can become infected by intimate contact with someone who has an active infection. In one case, a person was kissed on the cheek by someone with a cold sore and was concerned about becoming infected.\n\nIn general, cold sores tend to re-occur when the immune system is impaired. Using multivitamins and a wide range of fruits and vegetables may help to boost immunity. Probiotics may also help to boost immunity.\n\nIn some cases, antiviral medications like Acyclovir may be prescribed to prevent further outbreaks of the infection. Topical antiviral ointments like Rivera may also help.",

        "I have a history of cold sores, and am currently dealing with an outbreak.  I have been using Abreva, but I believe there is an infection because my lip and glands under my chin are extremely swollen.  The sore is not healing as quickly as it should be.  This has happened in the past and my doctor prescribed an antibiotic to help with the infection so it didnt spread.  What antibiotic will help with this that I could call into my doctor for?Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint cold sores are caused by viral infection, and it is a HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 1. The virus can remain dormant within the nerves and can get re-activated at any point of time and can cause an outburst. The severity of the symptoms depend upon the severity with which the infection has occurred, and it is not always necessary to have mild or severe symptoms and can vary at every outburst and in cases when there is some reduced immunity of the body the infection can occur with higher severity. As the antibiotics acts only against bacteria so taking an antibiotic for viral infection can no way cure the infection. Swollen lip and submental lymphadenopathy or swelling can be due to infection outbreak only. I would suggest you to consult an Infectious disease specialist or a dermatologist and get evaluated. You will be prescribed with oral anti viral like Acyclovir and Acyclovir for preventing further outbursts. Although the antivirals do not cure the current infection, but it prevents the further outbreaks of the infection. Applying Rivera which is a topical antiviral ointment can help and should be continued. Avoid making intimate contact wit other individuals as it can cause them infection as well as use personal things like towels, utensils etc. without sharing with others to prevent transmission of infection as it is a communicable disease. Hope this information helps. If you find the answer helpful kindly write a positive review and click on found this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. ",
        "I was kissed on the cheek by someone with a cold sore.  The person with the cold sore says that it is dried up, but it is still clearly visible, and my assumption is that it is still possibly contagious.  I washed my face and applied rubbing alcohol 8 hours later.  Have I received the virus? Also, if I touch my cheek and then touch another part of my face will I get a cold sore?Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint in case if someone has a cold sore actively present it means that the person is having high viral count leading to active infection and in this case the person is contagious and can transfer the virus to uninfected person by an intimate contact.Therefore, in your case there is a possibility that you are infected with the virus and although you may not get symptoms of the disease immediately and can become symptomatic when the viral count become considerably high in your body and skin. I would suggest you to get a blood investigation done at least after 2 weeks so that it can be ruled out that you are infected or not and treatment can be done accordingly. As of now you need not worry as t is not necessary that you will get the infection. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards."

Low hemoglobin, low resistance, protein deficiency are common causes of weak immune system. Infections like HIV infection also weaken immune system. Hashimotos disease is an autoimmune disease and family history of Hashimoto disease is unlikely to cause low immunity. Low immunity is responsible for increased predisposition to various infections.

        "Since last July, I ve had chronic sinus infections. I took 2 different rounds of 21 day antibiotics (July & Sept) with the sinus infections only to return a few weeks later. I had culture of sinuses done in Nov. and came back positive for Staph. (not MRSA). Was put on another antibiotic and follow-up appt showed fungal infection. I m now on a 15 day treatment (Fluconazole) and 6 week nasal nebulizer treatment (amphotericin) for the fungal. I also tested positive last week for Influenza and was put on Tamiflu for 5 days. Now I have hives developing on my body. All of this is crazy to me....why so many infections (bacterial, virus and fungal) in a short amount of time? I m 44 yr old female, 5 4, 140lbs, non-smoker, non-drinker. Any suggestions on tests to determine if I have an immunodeficiency disorder? Thanks!Hi and thanks for asking us on Chat Doctor. You have been treated heavily with antibiotics, antifungals and even antivirals - all these can undermine your immune system, making you more sensitive to the environment. Other factors that can suppress or disturb the immune system include sudden weight changes, stress, steroids and hormonal dysfunction. You are in your 40s, of normal weight - unless you have had a significant infection in the past that could have lead to immunodeficiency, I do not see the need to test for it. You could do a baseline blood test (full blood count, liver and kidney function) just to make sure all is well after taking so much medication. I suggest trying to rebuild your immune defense. Start taking fish oil generously (2 - 4 capsules daily), vitamin C with zinc, probiotics and antioxidants to start with. Be sure to stick to a nutritious diet rich in lean protein, vegetables and fruits. HY Chat Doctor.  Where the hives are concerned, you could take a short course of antihistamines. Soaking in oatmeal and applying a pre-college moisturizer can greatly help with symptoms. Use gentle skin cleansers and do not rub at your body with a rough towel after bath. Use soft towels and dab gently. I hope this helpsThank you",

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Protein rich diet is essential along with It A, C, E and B-complex to improve nutrition.2. Your daughter is still getting adjusted. The immune system is building up. Continue the healthy diet with good amount of fluids.3. The more she is exposed, the more the immune system will build up.

Is it right to give him oxygen in the first stage although Sat 97% because we do not know whether it s real chest pain or not? Please help to give your advice. Thanks.Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion no need to give oxygen if saturation on room air is 97%. As too much oxygen may cause side effects too. You should get done chest x-ray to rule out lung infection as cause of chest pain. Get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause for chest pain. If bronchospasm is present than start inhaled bronchodilators. So try to search cause for chest pain and treat accordingly.  No need to give oxygen.",
        "My family has a history of respiratory issues, we live at 4600 ft in Utah, she just returned from a trip to Shadow mountain which is at even higher elevation and her allergies (so we think) flared. One day after coming home she is breathing hard, chest hurts and her oxygen while sleeping is currently bouncing between 89=90 using oxyometer on her fore finger (on her middle finger is was 85-88), our insurance is horrible, our deductible is $8000 out of pocket before any help kicks in so if you think that what I am doing, which is, gave her benedryl, flonase nasal spray, and using provental inhaler while monitoring her oxygen is good hoping it clears up now she is back home, if so, what is the lowest while asleep her oxygen should be and while awake? Thank you for your response Sandy DawsonThanks for asking your question completely understand your problem first thing is normal value as per pulse oximeter ID 98% and there is no difference in saturation of oxygen in state of sleep of awake in a normal person. And minimum normal value should be greater than88%, so during awake or sleep oxygen saturation in pulse oximeter should be more than 88% to 92 % to perfectly oxygenate all the working organs of the body.thanks/regardsfeel free to ask more questions may god bless your family with good health",
        "Hi, my husband had phnemiua and his oxygen level in the blood was 66% his right lung was full and it was going into his left lung he was hospitalized could you tell me all about the seriousness of it all the hospital doesnt explain it to me. thank youThanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Normal oxygen saturation of body is more than 95%. So 66% saturation is considered as very low. Pneumonia is common cause for low oxygen saturation. Pneumonia if uncontrolled and extensive can cause collapse, consolidation and pleural effusion. All these causes non-functioning of involved lung. So oxygenation (main function of lungs) is hampered. This is having poor prognosis. Body can not sustain for long time with this much low oxygen level. After sometimes kidney, heart and brain start loosing their functions due to low oxygen saturation. So his condition is extremely serious. Prognosis in such cases is very poor. So discuss with your doctor and start vigorous treatment to control pneumonia. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks.",
        "I have a family member who is currently in ICU. Last Sunday, she was placed on a ventilator and removed from the vent a couple of days later. Currently, she has been decreased from 60L of high flow oxygen to 40L (they are trying to wean her from the high flow oxygen). While resting, she is tolerating the weaning process well. Her O2 saturation remains in the high 90s to 100 and her blood gases are improving and from my understanding, acceptable. However, if she is turned or physically moved up in the bed, etc., her numbers (mainly her O2 saturation) bottoms out and it takes her anywhere from 30 minutes to as long as an hour to recover and get her numbers back up. The doctors and nurses are telling us that they do not know why this is happening. To me, that is very concerning. Could you offer any insight as to why this is happening? She has been diagnosed with COPD (related to smoking) and was not on any oxygen therapy prior to being admitted into the hospital. They did state that her lungs have suffered extensive damage and when I asked how extensive, they could not tell me because she was unable to perform a PF test. She had an upper respiratory infection, which led to her going to the ER initially.1St of all you are having a good medical knowledge, just for your appreciation. & if, she is having COPD, then probably her baseline o2 saturation would be low only, if you have previous documented data, or if u know about it, then it would be possible reason for this. Or she might be in right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, which would lead to decrease o2 saturation on lying down position from sitting, if so, diuretics will work.In my opinion, if she has improved from ventilator with satisfactory ABG, she may do well with sufficient bronchodilators, & if spo2 at room air is less than 88, then with home o2 or SOS home BiPAP."

I have sleep apnea, but I have not been using my c-pap machine and recently had an abnormal EKG and have to undergo more testing on that. Could this all be related and what could be causing it?The answer to your question, if I have, it right is that the symptoms that you report may be related to sleep apnea. With this problem, you are working very hard all night long resulting in fractured and non-restful sleep. The physical work and difficulty breathing may produce a variety of health problems. Proper treatment is essential as is losing the weight that is so often at the root of the problem. If your breathing apparatus is uncomfortable your physician or sleep provider can help find a setup that will work for you.",

I can understand your concern. The way you are describing your symptoms, there is very high possibility of sleep apnea in your case. Sleep study is must for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. And based on severity on sleep study, titration with BiPAP /CPAP is done. So CPAP will definitely help you but for exact titration of CPAP pressures, you need to sleep study. So CPAP use is must in your case. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

My doctor says it could be stress related but at the moment now i can t really think of anything that could be stressing me out. I don t have any stress that i know of. Please advise.Hi there, thanks for asking. As you mention it is a serious issue. It is good that you are checked for thyroid function. Hypothyroidism can bring increased weight, and also slow heart beats. It could be also related to sleep apnea, because it is common in obese people (your BMI is 35.45) and it also could lead to slow heart beats. Other symptoms of thyroid hypofunction are change in your hair and skin texture and also constipation and loss of concentration and may be low mood. Other symptoms of sleep apnea are fatigue during the day and also being sleepy all the time, probably lower mood than normal. If you have allergy, deviated septum, enlarged tonsils, TMJ problem, or you go frequently to washroom in the night, or you have headache in the morning, this could be more likely. It is good that your basic electrolytes and also magnesium and calcium be checked. I wish the best health for you.",

C. Sleep apnea is a disease where patient feels cessation of breath during sleep. So when anyone who feel pauses of breath, surely he will feel anxiety and this will produce hypertension and anxiety. Hypertension is a curable disease so don't take it as unusual. Sleep Aeneas attacks occurs 5- 30 times in an hour. If low breathing than we call it hypopnea. Pl get on polysomnogram (sleep study) to find out exact nature of apnea. Stomach pain is due to acute gastritis so consult a physician and have treatment according to condition. Regards "

I understand your query and concern. Heart issues usually stem from anxiety related panic attacks. In all such cases its always safe to have organic heart lesions ruled out. I advise you to have a baseline 2 dimensional echocardiography, ECG and lipid profile to assess the basic cardiac reserve of your heart. Restrict the intake of salt to less than 6g/day. Regular physical exercise in the form of brisk walk for 20 min a day for 5 days a week is pretty useful. Chat Doctor. Reduce the intake of fatty and fried food.",

        "my boyfriend told me yesteday that at the GUM clinic he had been told he had symptoms of chlamydia, I know i never gave it to him and he swears hes been faithful. i also found out that he has had it in the past, could this be why he has these problems now. PLEASE help this could make or break our relationshipHi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria chlamydia trachomas, and it easily spreads because it often causes no symptoms.  In fact, about 75% of infections in women and 50% in men are without symptoms. Hence, it may be unknowingly passed to sexual partners. Symptoms in men produced due to Chlamydia include the following:1. Small amounts of clear or cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis.2. Pain during urination.3. Burning and itching sensation around the opening of the penis.4. Pain and swelling of the testicles. The condition can be diagnosed by use a swab to take a sample from the urethra in men or from the cervix in women and then the specimen is sent to a laboratory to be analyzed. Treatment is by administration of oral antibiotics with azithromycin or doxycycline. It is recommended the partner(s) also be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread of the disease. It is very important that you always use condoms during sexual intercourse to lower your risk of contracting or passing on infections such as Chlamydia. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",

By the way, he did suffer with kidney stones approximately 4 years ago. Thank youGood morning,1) Jaundice at birth (pre-mature baby) is temporary condition, and it resolves by self within few days without need for any specific treatment.2) There is no correlation between history of jaundice at birth with present episode of jaundice3) Jaundice affect appetite, and it leads to loss of weight.4) stomach pain during episode of jaundice mostly due to effect on liver (most probably hepatitis)5) low measurement of hemoglobin may be due to high level of bilirubin in blood which affect measurement of hemoglobin level.6) For further treatment, his blood report of liver function, complete blood count and USG abdomen for liver are essential; this gives idea about reasons responsible for development of jaundice",
        "My son was jaundiced on the 3rd day of life. The doctor said It was physioloogic andd would clear but on the 7th day he was placed under the light foor 6 days but the eyes did not clear. The doctor assured it will clear but a month later its stilll same. We went baack aand we were told he needs be transfused. After transfusion his head becamE bigger and jaundice incresed. What could be wrong?Thanks for posting your query here. Newborn jaundice which usually appears around day 3-5 of life is usually physiological. This is related to immaturity of liver and as the liver becomes more mature, the jaundice disappears. This type of jaundice is very common. Not all the babies having physiological jaundice need treatment. I would like to know what his blood results were when he was first treated for jaundice? Is there any mismatch between yours and your sons blood group? Treatment helps to lower the jaundice levels, but it doesn't disappear completely. That's the reason that eyes did not clear.You've mentioned that his jaundice has increased and head is bigger. I would like to know his recent blood results - Bilirubin and his CBC. Have you been breast-feeding him exclusively? Is he gaining weight? Also, for increased head size, please get is measured and discuss with your current doctor whether that is normal for his age or not. There are a lot of things to consider - clinical examination, blood test results etc. before diagnosing what's exactly wrong. Please do return with the results of blood test and further answers to questions I want to know, and I will be able to guide you further. Regards Chat Doctor. ",

        "hello sir i was diagnosed w devicks syndrom cardiomyapthy and mulitple herniated discs rt now i have metalic taste in my mouth head and neck r hurting im dizzy and have chest pain and down my left arm idk if i should go to the er or if its just a new attack from the devicsHello, I can understand your concern. Metallic taste in mouth could be due to medications, food allergies or CNS problem. It is possible that the medicines you might be taking for cardiomyopathy and probably control of blood pressure may cause metallic taste in mouth. In addition, some CNS disorder that impairs the sensory messages to brain from several areas of body can be responsible for the metallic taste in mouth. As your head and back are hurting and you are feeling dizzy too, I would advise you to visit the doctor treating you for Device syn Chat Doctor.

        "I got new dentures a few months back since then I have this salty taste in my mouth and throat..it even make my mouth feel stickey. What is the cause. I have been to the dr to check if its the meds I use. I have been to a throat nose and mouth specialist and he could not understand what is causing it.Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As you describe in your query that you have metallic taste in your mouth which could be due to dentures as material used in making dentures can sometimes cause these symptoms. Other factors are medicines like antibiotics and medicines used for blood pressure control, gum problems like gingivitis and periodontitis, poor oral hygiene and cold and sinusitis. I would suggest you to chew on sugar-free gum and candies to stimulate salivary flow. The taste of the mouth will get to the normal as soon as we remove the causative factor. Visit oral physician once and get denture examined completely and start treatment accordingly. For now eat fresh fruits and chew hard peppermint candy. Hope your concern had been resolved. Best Wishes,"

I can understand your concern for your family member. Incomplete data like age, gender, purpose of doing the lab test C reactive protein, results of other tests and presenting problem. High levels of C reactive protein with a history of passing blood in the stool is suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease like ulcerative colitis.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. ESR of 80 indicates severe inflammation.2. Correlation with C-reactive proteins level is necessary. If CRP is also elevated, then possible inflammation anywhere in the body needs to be evaluated.3. Gall stones can induce mild inflammation. Associated with anemia and your previous history of a high normal - I suppose gallstones could be a cause. However, get a CRP done to rule out high inflammation.4. If ESR crosses 100, autoimmune disorders, multiple myeloma or chronic infections like tuberculosis requires evaluation. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.",

Does his level of 45 mean he has protein a deficiency or does it still have time to rise to normal levels? Thank you.Hello, Welcome to the ChatDoctorThankyou for your questionImmunologic methods for the measurements of protein C include enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay and electroimmunoasay. Normaly in adults it approximates 70 to 140 percent of protein C antigen level of whole pooled plasma level. But in infants total protein is normal at lower level as compare to adults. And Also infants and neonates have lower levels of protein C than their adult counterparts, therefore age based normal ranges must be derived separately for the child Chat Doctor.

The back had to be left open to heal for three months......he suffered so much. The day before he dropped dead, his c reactive protein levels were 178. How dangerous is that level?My prayers are with you for this terrible tragedy. C-reactive protein is a nonspecific marker for inflammation, so the levels themselves aren't said to be dangerous. However, very high levels (which your son had) indicate a very severe inflammatory or infectious process going on. This could happen if the MRSA had spread into his bones or blood, or was somewhere in his body causing a chronic infection. Hope this answers your query. If you have further questions, I would be happy to answer them."

Ideal treatment, however, has not been established, and there is no ongoing clinical trial.

Some patients with severe or persistent disease or cases where organ function is threatened (such as breathing obstruction or kidney failure) may require treatment with surgery, steroids, and/or chemotherapy. Rarely radiation therapy may be used. Chemotherapy may include vinblastine, 6-MP, methotrexate, thalidomide, or Sleeve.

The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life not just in the body, but in the mind and spirit. Palliative therapies are clearly appropriate at the very advanced stages of the disease. Bur dear, our body never easily accept any foreign body, so the vague symptoms come out as constantly grumbling, and she has a lot of wind, primarily flatulence but some burping.  Her food should be simple nourishing easily digestible.appetite does not allow you to eat large meals, aim to eat several small meals throughout the day instead. If you simply cannot manage to eat many solid foods, use liquid meal replacements as a substitute. Proper nutrition helps enhance the immune system, improve strength, rebuild body tissues and decrease your risk of developing dangerous infections. Even if you do not feel hungry, it is still important to fuel your body with high-calorie foods throughout the day will suggest to administer a mixture which has helped many patients in prevention as well as cure, in such situation. The Mixture of extract of Lemon, Ginger, Garlic, Bark of Maringá tree, Vinegar of coconut water & Honey. Mix all well in equal quantity.  Give her dose of 20 ml with same amount of water twice before meal for 2 -3 days, and without water for 31 days or 41 days as required. Is a great antioxidant , will help her in her problem and much more. Hope this helps you in solving your query. Take care All the best Don't hesitate to get back if you have any further query.",

Sorry to hear about the death of your loved one. It is possible that he had stage 4 cancer of hypopharynx. This is a delicate condition and usually the patient is unable to maintain a good general health condition. Since they had released him from the hospital, nothing much might have been possible from treatment point of view. Hospice referral is for those cases who can be made to stay comfortable with opioid pain relievers like morphine. The goal is to give them peace and comfort. Morphine will not have caused any significant event resulting in death of the patient. Please do not worry."

Im 30 yrs. old and this illness started when I was 24. Sometimes I catch my breathe but I know its only in the  mind but I cant really help it sometimesHi Welcome to ChatDoctorI have gone through your query regarding cure of anxiety through acupuncture. Anxiety is one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. Many people suffer some form of anxiety occasionally, but others cannot manage this natural response to a stressful situation. When a person experiences a highly stressful or threatening scenario, the mind can be overloaded and fail to develop ways of coping. Acupuncture is an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine. It works on the principle of stimulating points in the body to correct imbalances in the flow of energy through channels known as meridians. This belief is based on the interaction of the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal and water) and having profound effects on internal organs, which are either yin or yang. Traditional Chinese medicine also recognizes the mind and body interacting as one, meaning that emotions have a physiological effect on the body. Western medical practitioners traditionally have questioned the validity of traditional Chinese medicines such as acupuncture. More recently, acupuncture has been recognized as a legitimate treatment for some conditions and is growing in popularity.<>Traditional Chinese medicine relates anxiety to an imbalance of the heart and kidney. Fire represents the heart and joy according to the five elements. The diagnosis is that too much heat in the heart will imbalance the interaction with the kidney (represented as water and fear).

Do you know of any topical books on such a subject?You have been through a lot of losses in your life. Grieving takes different lengths of time and is a very individualistic experience; there is no time limit in which the grief is \"over.\" It may very well be that the grief you are experiencing now is much worse because you did not fully grieve over the loss of your father and best friend 10 years ago. The best thing is to not place any judgment on your feelings, and let yourself be okay with grieving your first two losses at this juncture.

It usually results in an adjustment disorder though on occasions it can be severe, what we refer to as acute stress reaction. You would have to get over this initial phase of anger or depression over the next couple of months following which is required (is these symptoms persist), we would recommend appropriate medication or psychotherapy measures. At this juncture supportive psychotherapy by a (clinical) psychological counselor might be appropriate for you. Regards Chat Doctor. ",

Losing a close person is necessarily sad and grief is natural. But for how many days or months? This needs sincere answer. The man you are speaking about is under severe grief because he does not have anyone else to give the same affection he experienced earlier (Mind you, Every person goes through bereavement and almost everyone accepts it as part of life. This happens with other people supports. Also, the bereaved person slowly tries to ignore the negative thoughts when he starts working again). Your man do not have any other intimate relationship and I think he is idle nowadays. Both multiplies the problem. You can be with him, give him love and affection, and slowly he should start talking to you and accept you. God is great. Time is a great healer. Please post a direct question to me in this website.

Please help.Hi there ~ Bereavement can be a difficult thing.  It appears that you have not had any prior experiences with death in your family, close or extended, nor do you have any friends of friends who died.  Having problems with sleep and being anxious are common symptoms of bereavement and is not a cause of concern if the bereavement is recent.  You will probably get over the symptoms, or they will gradually improve over time.  However, if you feel like they are affecting your daily functioning in any way, I recommend that you see a psychiatrist for anxiety.  I hope this helps. Take care."

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can explain why a systolic and diastolic pressure difference of less than 20 points is a risk, what it means, and why the patient's blood pressure would not be expected to be higher with a steroid in this case.\n\nThe patient in question is a 60-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer, and she has been given a half-normal dose of anabolic steroid to help reduce abdominal and leg/foot edema. However, within 12 hours, she experiences a heart rate increase, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, and is told that if the distance between systolic and diastolic pressure gets less than 20 points, she needs to call for help.\n\nAccording to the context, the reason for this risk is that the woman might be having heart failure. In heart failure, the systolic pressure decreases fast, then the diastolic pressure, due to the poor force of contraction by the failing heart. This causes the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures to come down to less than 20. \n\nThe context also mentions that the doctor's initial assumption that the steroid would increase the patient's blood pressure is not true for all patients, especially in cases of heart failure.\n\nRegarding the steroid shot for your son, the context explains that steroids can cause side effects such as peptic ulcer, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, sore throat, and oro-pharyngeal candidiasis.\n\nLastly, regarding your wife's situation, the context suggests that increasing her prednisolone dose might not be helpful, especially since she has osteoporosis and adrenal fatigue.",

        "60 yr old woman, dying of pancreatic cancer.  Given 1/2 normal dose anabolic steroid to help reduce abdominal and leg/foot edema. Within 12 hours, heart rate up, difficulty breathing, BP low, and was told that IF the distance between systolic and diastolic gets less than 20 points, she needs to call for help.  Can you explain WHY that is a risk, what it means?  Also, wouldnt you expect BP to be higher with a steroid??  thank youThanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, you are right about rise in blood pressure after steroid injection. But it is not true for all patients. The woman in question might be having heart failure. Heart failure can cause breathlessness, low systolic pressure (hypotension) and edema feet. In this, steroids won't help. Diuretic and other cardiac supportive Chat Doctor.  In heart failure, systolic pressure decreases fast then diastolic pressure. This is due to poor force of contraction by failing heart. So difference between systolic and diastolic pressures come down to less than 20. And when this occurs, patient needs urgent treatment in the form of isotropic ",
        "my son will be 3 in april. he went to the doctor today with swollen tonsils. His speech is effected with words beginning with c,k,g and his snoring is aweful. the doctor wants to give him a steroid shot in 1 week if they don t go down-doctor said it was virally induced-but did say there were side effects. What exactly are the side effects? He also has asthma and has had the swollen tonsils for 3 weeks.Hi, Steroids reduce inflammation and pain due to any cause. They suppress all the immunity response of the body by inhibiting all the chemicals causing inflammation. Steroids are very useful in bronchial asthma. A short term use of steroid shots for 3 to 4 days may not cause severe side effects. Long term use of steroids for months can cause peptic ulcer, hypertension, diabetes and osteoporosis. Inhaled steroids can cause sore throat and oro-pharyngeal candidiasis. Hence, gargling of the mouth should be done regularly after using inhalers. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

I understand your concern. All the automatic blood pressure monitors are pre-programmed and just an interpretation in that doesn't confirm or rule out an underlying problem.

        "Hi Dr. XXXXXX. My dad is recovering from pneumonia. He is 95 years old, no heart problems and was hospitalized. No intubation was done in ICU and he was released to his home. His blood count and pressure is normal, he can eat and is breathing on his own. The question is about a CPAP machine to help him with his respiration and oxygen levels. Is a CPAP useful to maintain a positive air flow or is just for people with sleep apnea? Thank you, AlejandroThanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Initially CPAP was used only in cases of sleep apnea. But nowadays due to large patient centric trials, indications of CPAP are many besides sleep apnea. It is now treatment of choice for heart failure and COPD patients to maintain proper oxygenation. The indication in pneumonia is there but only in hemodynamically stable patient. And only in ICU (intensive care unit) facility where close observation is possible and if needed invasive ventilation is possible. So if patient of pneumonia is alert and maintaining good blood pressure and other vitals than he/she can be given CPAP for positive air flow to improve oxygenation, but only under close observation in an ICU setting.",
        "I have developed as of late a bout of PVCs mostly in evening and sleeping hours that are accompanied by a flushing sensation in my shoulders and head. I check my BP and during these same time periods it is higher than normal (120/78 <150/95) Could the higher BP be related to the stress of PVCs and lack of sleep?Hello, Actually PVC can only be detected in EKG. Only if there are any symptoms, then one can say it is PVC. Some of these symptoms are flushing sensation in the head and in the shoulder. But it can be caused by another illness as well and other functional factors. High blood pressure may be not related to PVC. Because PVC is a complex phenomenon; most of the time it is nonspecific and may disappear on its own. Hope I have answered your query, Let me know for further assistance."

When I was 11 my head got smashed against a brick wall, and ever since my face, hand ( I think it was my left side), goes numb, get a headache, blurred vision, see double and I can only see in front of me not the sides of my eyes. I can t function I take pain pills and go to sleep. I got this all the time, it has gotton less and less but I want to know what this is.Hi, Thanks for writing in. Symptoms such as numbness, headache, blurred vision and double vision should be investigated in detail. If you had an injury to the left side of your face then certain nerve injury might be suspected. However, for the eyes, getting examined by the ophthalmologist is essential. You should not ignore the problem with eyes. There are small muscles around the eyes and these help in moving the eyes in a particular direction so that you can see properly. These small muscles are supplied by specific nerves and damage to these nerves can cause problems like blurred vision or double vision. Clinical tests have to be done to make certain any problems with the nerves. Since you also complain of headaches and numbness therefore a clinical neurological examination is also suggested. After examining your doctor might ask tests which might include CT scan of MRI scan of brain and orbits which will show details of the eyes also. Treatment depends on clinical findings. Please do not worry.",

Since you are not able to figure out why its happening and all, I would like to ask you - what sort of bad sight you have? Are you having double vision, blurred vision, any balance difficulty while walking, any other neuropathic symptoms?  If any of the above is present you should meet up a neurologist and may be an MRI might be needed to understand the center of vision in the brain.  The optic nerve also may need testing to understand if any optic nerve pathology is causing this or not. Also, have a check with the ophthalmologist, so we can see if any visual disturbances are due to retina factor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Getting an ophthalmology examination will help understand the matter. As we age the vision gets disturbed and needs some spectacles for the same.

You have dizziness and vision problem.  It may be due to anemia or low blood pressure. You should check your hemoglobin and blood pressure.  You should also go for ophthalmological examination to rule out any local cause. Then you should take treatment accordingly.  For anemia, you should go for complete blood count and peripheral smear examination and anemia profile.  It will give you exact cause of anemia. Then you should take treatment accordingly.

        "Hi, I have suffered chronic Migraine for ovre 30 years but for the last 6 months I have had more migraines than ever, a persistent daily headache, and toothache , I have even had the tooth extracted but am still suffering severe pain. I have had all the scans going. I have vascular malformations in upper thorax , mri s have shown bony lesions in skull and spine with further treatments and investigations pending. I have even had a mouthguard made by the dentist but after a few days of wearing this at night it has blistered my gums which adds to the pain. Don t know where to turn to.Hello, Thanks for posting this question in ChatDoctorLet me tell you the causes of headache are many and one has to find out the exact cause. Headache can be due to migraine, cluster headache, brain tumor, infection, vascular malformations and so on.  I have noted all your problems need to be re-evaluated in a hospital/teaching medical university with Multidisciplinary facility where neurologist/headache specialist / dentist/ interventional radiologist will jointly evaluate you. Their clinical evaluation will determine if you need a brain MRI scan (I am not sure if you have done to rule out any vascular malformation in the brain too). Some people may harbor vascular malformations in multiple sites of the brain. If it turns out to be migraine (which is a diagnosis of exclusion), you will benefit with the following approach1. Acute attack: simple analgesics. Sumatriptan nasal spray. Avoid the precipitating factor. Avoid stress, coffee and lack of sleep. Do regular exercises and good sleep hygiene2. During the chronic phase: You may take one of these medicines: Amitriptyline, propranolol, topiramate, valproate etc. The changes which are seen in the skull and spike are due to the presence of long standing vascular malformation. Hope this helps",

I am 53, 270 lbs, have low blook pressure, low cholestral, fairly active, but stressed. I m an accountant.Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms could be related to tension type headache, which is a benign type of headache related to physical and emotional stress. Some other possible causes like: low blood pressure and blood pressure fluctuations, chronic anemia, thyroid dysfunction, etc. could also mimic this clinical scenario. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a cervical spine x-ray study to exclude chronic degeneration of the vertebral column-complete blood count for anemia- PCR and ESR for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction. I would also advise you to monitor your blood pressure values during these episodes of headache. A brain MRI would also help exclude other intracranial causes, especially if the headache is persistent. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your complaints. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Wishing good health, "

When I try to sleep without hypnodorm, I get no sleep at all, abviously I am addicted to them and I am finding it very difficult to get off them.Hi welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query. Regarding your sleep disorder. Insomnia is a relatively common sleeping disorder, affecting about one-third of the adult population worldwide. As you know our sleep disorder is not only a sleep factor, is much more than that Sleep depends on how strong is our mental health. Your physical health is just as Important as your mental health and both can influence each other. So it is vital to keep your self healthy. Gulping on medicine will not work in any health problem Not even in INSOMNIA unless you take care for your lifestyle, food habits & exercise. Common problems with sleep are often easily ad Chat Doctor.  Taking your mind off the problem can help to relax you and may help you to fall back asleep. Check your pillow and mattress. Is it comfortable ? Keep a gap of 1-2 hours in dinner and bedtime. Take light meals. Take a T spoon of almond oil and 1/2 spoon Turmeric powder With cup of hot milk strengthens mental power gives resistance against diseases. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially before bedtime - both can increase nighttime urination and increase sleep disturbances. Reactions of medicines also cause insomnia. If you can't sleep because of thoughts hovering on your mind, try the Relaxing Breath - DEEP BREATHING FOR SOOTHING MIND. It can help you put aside the thoughts that are keeping you awake. A few stretches can help with sleep aid, too. Meditation also helps to induce positive thoughts & brings sleep. Regular exercise, Walk, intake of healthy natural diet containing all (fiber, veges, fruit in natural form minerals & vitamins) essential nutrients helps a lot by helping metabolism to strengthen our immune system to help us stay healthy disease free life.  Life is like a wheel, if 1 spoke is displaced, movement of wheel is imbalanced same is the case with us. If our body is not healthy, our mind will be unhealthy. And we face disturbed sleep. So, we must work for improving total health for happy, healthy, disease free life preferably without being dependent on meds, for small issues . You can take Homeopathic Nun Voice 30 /1 dose at bedtime /7 days Kali for daily / morning & evening hope this will help solve your query Take care.

        "I have been suffering from Sexual Anhedonia and can ejaculate but feel no orgasm. It s been about 23 years. I ve been times with psychiatric meds and again without psychiatric meds and the meds seem to have no effect on causing or helping the anhedonia issue. Several therapists have placed the cause on years of constant rejection and belittlement from my wife, who accepts no responsibility in the development of the problem. I have been trying to convince myself that I deserve to enjoy sex, since I have been conditioned to believe I don t deserve to orgasm. I see you listed something called the Masters and XXXXXXX technique? I am beyond desperate for help.Hello Sexual Macedonia or decreased libido is really a distressing problem. You can ejaculate but feel no orgasm. You have been on psychiatric medicines also. See a number of medicines used in psychiatry can cause decrease in libido and can result in orgasmic. Persisting complaints result in dysfunction in family and which further aggravate the problem. A vicious cycle is formed in which individual loses self-confidence. Commonly used medicines like Sildenafil, Tadalafil etc. help to improve erection but these medicines don't improve libido. I would advise you to increase your diet with fenugreek seeds. These have good medicinal value in decreased libido. Apart from that herbal medicines like Wanted forte and Confide can be taken to increase the libido. The medicines can be taken without prescription also and are safe to use. Get your hormonal profile done to find out any hormonal problem. Total testosterone, Free testosterone, and DHEA values are deranged in low libido cases. Hope this helps you, thanks",
        "I would like to press charges too lol, I to have had the same thing happen EXCEPT I took Wellbutrin **150mg** for 3 days... thats 1 pill a day then I stopped (to many side effects) I use to have sex 8-9 times a day and now I maybe have sex one a month and thats only because my partner is in need I dont really have an interest in it! I need this to change!! it also effected my drinking. I liked to have at least one beer or a drink when I got home from work plus im a very social drinker now I cant have a sip of a beer or drink or i feel like something it really wrong and i get panicy and absent minded also a bit fanty.... I need to fix this soon too. iv been off it for maybe... this is month 4 but still i only took THREE pills....First your problem is easily treatable so don't worry. You should start paroxetine CR and bupropion Sr initially in low doses. Then increase them. It will help you lot. As anxiety and stress are causes of loss of libido so first remove the stress. You can use tadalafil to stay longer and regain confidence. For libido take some multivitamins like trifold plus Napoleon etc. They all will help you a lot. You should go counselling side by side.  So don't worry.  Hope my suggestions helpful and thankful to you. Take care."

There are procedures (panchakarma treatments) which are done to strengthen inner ear and vestibulococlear nerve. So its helpful even in the case of degeneration. You can use medicated oil (karma tail) which has to be put into ears. But you have to consult an Ayurvedic physician for complete treatment. To avoid these type of problems, as a preventive care, Ayurvedic daily regimens (dinacharya) suggest putting oils into ears (karma Purana) daily. This is the best method to keep your ears healthy and sharp even in old age. Wishing you good health",

The treatment of tinnitus depends on the underlying cause. A complete physical examination including careful examination of your ear by a Doctor is necessary to identify the cause. Persistence of symptom over 5 years suggest that the exact cause is still to be identified. If the cause of the problem remains unknown, I will advise you consult an otolaryngologies where you may be given hearing and nerve tests. He may also ask for CT scan or MRI to reveal any structural problem that may cause tinnitus. Treatment options depend on cause which may include:-ear wax removal if caused by wax-Infection treatment if of infectious origin-Surgery if necessary in rare cases of tumor, cyst or otosclerosis-Changing medications if induced by Chat Doctor. If tinnitus continues after treating the identified cause, noise suppression will be the next option Hope my answer helps you in the next step to take. Best regards",
        "Hello Dr. Rangadhar, This is regarding my daughter who is 5 yrs old.  It has been said that she had SHL problem in both the ears and has been advised to use hearing aids which she is not very comfortable with. I would like to know if there is any Homeopathy treatment for this problem?.  She also gets cold very often and her nose gets blocked most of the nights and sneezes a lot in the morning after getting up from bed. Can I get some advice from you?Thankyou,ReziHello friend, Thank you for posting your query through Chat Doctor. Sudden hearing loss (SHL) is a name given by conventional medicine to those patients whose nervous system involved in hearing is damaged by past suppressive treatments given for complaints of cold. Getting frequent cold is a genetic and constitutional disease, which should have been treated with Homeopathy. There are very good remedies like Tuberculinum, Bart carb, Silica, Cascara carb etc. for preventing frequent cold and other connected diseases. With this sort of remedies, the constitutional tendency to get cold is rapidly and permanently treated successfully in Homeopathy. Such child Chat Doctor. "

While writing you have problem of mixing letters, and you have to erase and write again. It may occur due to dyslexia, but dyslexia is common in childhood and less common in high school. It may occur because of mild form of depression. Mild form of depression may present with poor concentration, poor performance in studies. It may be a sign of early stages of OCD. As you have problem of writing and erasing words, it may be a feature of OCD. But for definitive diagnosis detailed evaluation is needed.

It has developed over the last month of so with more decline noted recently. Perhaps multiple pin strokes?Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to know the exact details of onset of his symptoms and any history of medical conditions. Above symptoms can be due to mildly reduced blood supply to the white matter areas in the brain including the areas concerning speech. These can also be due to a series of small stroke like episodes. Another reason for cognitive and speech impairment can also be conditions like hypertension and diabetes. These can also cause microhemorrhages in brain leading to confusion and slurred speech. It will be best to consult a neurologist and get investigations like carotid artery and vertebral artery Doppler and brain MRI scan. Treatment will depend on clinical and imaging findings.",

        "I have something called neroensomiliacia- I don t know if the spelling is correct, but I have a piece of my brain gone. I don t know how else to say it. My questions are 1) the space that is where my brain is suppose to be, what is there now, it is an empty space or fluid there. 2) Besides a weakened side what other things could be affected by this.Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. The condition you are describing, is called euro encephalomalacia, which is a condition characterized by localized softening of brain tissues due to inflammation or hemorrhage. The softening may occur in a specific part of the brain or may be more widespread. The treatment for this disease mainly consists of detecting the underlying cause behind the change in brain consistency and dealing with it properly. In extremely severe cases, damaged brain substance may be removed by surgery. However, the brain consistency undergoes a considerable change due to the removal of the softened brain material.-Regarding your questions, the space that was previously occupied by brain mass, now it is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) is normally produced by your brain, and has three main functions: protects brain and spinal cord from trauma. CSF supplies nutrients to nervous system tissue and removes waste products from cerebral metabolism-As with any surgical procedure, complications may occur. Brain surgery risk is tied to the specific location in the brain that the operation will affect. For example, if the area of the brain that controls speech is operated on, then speech may be affected. I mean the side effects depend on the part of the brain which is resected. Hope I answered to your question. Take care,"

    "question": "What are some different meanings and uses of the term \"cut\" in various contexts, and how does its application differ across fields such as film, fashion, and everyday language?\nBetter give me some examples.",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can see that the term \"cut\" has different meanings and uses across various contexts. \n\nIn the context of medical emergencies, a cut can refer to an injury caused by a sharp object, such as a cut artery (as in the case of the radial artery on the forearm). The chances of dying from such an injury depend on several factors, including the size of the artery, the time elapsed before medical attention, and the condition of the patient. The attending doctor is the only one who can determine the present condition.\n\nIn the context of copper T, a cut can refer to the removal of the device. There is a 3% chance of failure with Cut. If pregnancy occurs with copper T on, it can be continued if it's healthy, but the removal of the device can cause abrasion at the site of implantation leading to abortion.\n\nIn the context of personal health, a cut can refer to an injury or a lesion. For example, a cut on the penis can be caused by skin-related ailments or infections, and a cut on the gums can be caused by a toothbrush injury or food particles.\n\nIn everyday language, a cut can simply refer to a wound or an injury caused by a sharp object.\n\nThe term \"cut\" can also refer to a film editing technique, where a scene is removed or shortened. However, this context is not present in the provided material.\n\nIn fashion, a cut can refer to the style or design of a garment, but this context is also not present in the provided material.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, the term \"cut\" has different meanings and uses across medical emergencies, copper T, personal health, and everyday language.",

        "Hey,  my friend cut her radial artery last night. Her dad told me it was on her forearm not her wrist. I have no idea if shes alive or dead Ive tried everything to get hold of her, Im so worried. What are the chances for dying of something like that, how deep would she have to had cut. If not what kind of long term damage could there be? How much blood would she have lost roughly, would that damage her brain? Thank you. :)Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  There are so many factors to decide the outcome of the cut of any artery. There are arteries of different sizes, radial artery is small at the wrist, and a bit big at the fore arm. Depending on the size and time lapsed decides the loss of blood, and condition of the patient. After a long time means the loss blood will be more, and the patient will be in coma, and may affect any organ.  We can have a book of 1000 pages on this issue. The attending doctor only can decide the present condition.  Wishing her a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.",

Blood pressure has a diurnal variation. It is less in morning and progresses as the day progresses. It is more in afternoon and evenings. Pulse rate varies with exertion. Pulse rate does not signify anything unless it is very less like thready or increased to more than 100. Normal pulse rate is 60-100.

My monitor has also highlighted an irregular heart beat on numerous occassions.Yesterday evening in a space of 30 minutes my blood pressure varied from 132/116/101 to 110/69/121. Is this a cause for concern.Hello welcome to Chat Doctor. It would have been great help if you had mentioned your age and if you are suffering from any symptoms. Since your monitor shoes a raised pulse rate and as per your description it is irregular, I recommend you an ECG initially and if the ECG comes normal, then a 24 HR Holder monitoring should be done which records your ECG for 24 hrs while you go about your routine day-to-day activities. It will show whether you have any heart rhythm disturbances. Variable BP reading in 30 mins seem unlikely. Electronic monitors cannot be perfectly relied upon for BP recording. So I do not see the need to worry about the BP. Checking BP so frequently implies that you are anxious. Please stop worrying about your BP. Check it only once a week at variable times of the day. Wishing you good healthRegards",

        "I have been on Metropolol for 4 weeks, prescribed for palpitations (400 in 24 hrs. per monitor) 50 mg. Also I have white coat syndrome, sometimes pressure rises, been under a great deal of stress, mostly apprehension re: heart tests, etc. Cardiologist says metropolol is good for bp also. I have a monitor, pressure is lower at home, only rises when I maybe active 150/62, pulse in the 70 s and has been as low as 112/60. Still I take readings to the Dr. to let him see that it really is when I am under stress. 50mg made me tired ( Cardio said it would be sluggish), I do feel calmer, had to do 25 twice a day. Still I can fall asleep sitting watching TV and that is not me. I think I could try 25 per day, that is how I started out, but my pressure in theDr. office was 162/63 so he changed it to 50. Now I notice my pressure is higher anywhere from 112 to 175 with the bottom # in the 70 s and my pulse in the 60 s. My Dr. didn t mention the fact that it was compared to at home readings, also because I am calmer in office reading was only 136/62 He thought all the numbers were good, but yet they were higher than before when I took them at home. I don t get it, I thought BP meds reduced your pressure.With respect to palpitation, that is the sensation not the extra beats. The extra beats may not be harmful or even require treatment. If you have found no underlying heart disease or dangerous rhythm, the primary concern is to relieve your symptoms and anxiety. Finding nothing dangerous does not necessarily mean that heart rhythm is not the source of what you feel but knowing that it's not dangerous is often treatment enough. The best way to interpret your blood pressure is to take only recording done on schedule. Single measures should not prompt concern, particularly no those done under stress. Record your blood pressure on a schedule every day. It should be taken seated after a 10-15 min period of relaxation. A two-week average is what you use to make decisions about the need to take a medicine and its effect."

I take BP medicine (Covance 25). I drink alcohol. I have no chest pain but some times slight giddiness experienced.What is your advice please?Hello welcome to Chat Doctor. Your ECG reports suggests possibility of lack of blood supply or ischemia of the anterior and inferior walls of the heart. So you should get evaluated for the same. As you mentioned TMT effort tolerance is good. But what is more important in a treadmill test is whether it is positive or negative. A positive treadmill test increases the possibility of heart blockages. A negative stress test implies no detectable blockages in the heart. Please also do a 2d echo to see the contractile function of the heart, the valves and the flow between the valves. Please specify the treadmill result, and do a 2d echo. If treadmill is negative and 2d echo is normal then you need not worry about it. If either treadmill is positive or 2d echo shows regional wall motion abnormality, you should visit your cardiologist and get an angiography done. Wishing you good health. Regards",

I am a scientist by profession and physically active and walk for more than an hour everyday and i am doing this for the last 15 years.Hi, In your TMT test result: mild effort tolerance means that the test was terminated quite early, and ST depression usually indicates the presence of ischemia. But you should know that sometimes the TMT test can have false positive results, so I would advise you to have another test done, the best can be stress echocardiography, it is more specific test than treadmill test. Hope I could help nourishing you good health In case of further questions don't hesitate to ask"

    "answer": "The concept of the incubation period influences the understanding of the timeline and progression of various biological or medical phenomena by indicating the time between exposure to a pathogen and the onset of symptoms.\n\nFor example, in the case of rabies, the incubation period is variable, ranging from 3 weeks to 3 years. This means that symptoms may not appear immediately after exposure to the virus, but rather after a period of time that can range from a few weeks to several years.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of the human papillomavirus (HPV), the incubation period is also variable, ranging from 8 weeks to 8 months. This means that it may take several weeks or months for symptoms to appear after exposure to the virus.\n\nIn both cases, the incubation period is important for understanding the timeline and progression of the disease, and for determining the best course of treatment.\n\nIn the context of the provided material, the concept of incubation period is also relevant to the discussion of premature birth. The Chat Doctor mentions that the lungs of premature babies are poorly developed, which can affect their ability to breathe and survive. The incubation period of the baby is not explicitly mentioned in this context, but it is implied that the baby's development is delayed due to premature birth.\n\nHowever, in the context of the provided material, the concept of incubation period is not mentioned in relation to the baby born at 21 weeks. The Chat Doctor discusses the factors that affect the baby's ability to survive, such as lung maturity and gestational age, but does not mention incubation period.",

        "Good day. i just wanted to ask if what are the earliest and visible signs of rabies in humans? i was bitten by a dog 3 days ago and its not that deep bite. my skin was only peeled a little and theres no blood coming out after the bite. now, i am experiencing itch not on the site of bite but on any part of my body. im afraid if this is a sign of rabies or its only a skin problem. i have no fever nor signs of flu. only that itch. thank you!Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The incubation period in case of rabies is variable ranging from 3 weeks to 3 years. If you are scratched by a stray dog 3 days and following which you have developed generalized hives all over the body. These symptoms are not the signs and symptoms of the disease rabies. I would suggest you to take active immunization with antirabies vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28. Thank you.",

Having read that it is often associated  with the human papilloma virus, how long does the virus take to develop?Hello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious disease specialist, answering your concern.HPV has usually very long incubation period. Average incubation period is three months, but it can be varied from 8 weeks to 8 months. Many a time though changes has started developing at microscopic level, but they are grossly very clear.

The actual age of the baby is twelve weeks behind the age you measure after birth. So physical development is normal. For mental development, there is relaxation up to two years of age for preterm. You can consult a local pediatrician for that. There are chances as in the general population for a chance of preterm in the next pregnancy. Hope I have answered your query.

This implies that the appearance of a line is a sign of pregnancy.\n* In the third context, the doctor describes the patient's symptoms as \"vascular origin\" and mentions that the sign could be \"any thromboembolic phenomenon\" or \"any acute infection.\" This suggests that the patient's symptoms are signs of a potential underlying condition.\n* In the fourth context, the doctor mentions that the patient's symptoms could be caused by \"nutritional problems like vitamin b12, b6 deficiency\" and suggests that a \"complete blood workup done along with serum b12 levels\" is necessary to rule out these causes. This implies that certain physical or behavioral changes can be signs of nutritional deficiencies.\n\nIn the context of communication, there is no specific mention of the term \"signs.\" However, the concept of \"signs\" is implied in the context of the home pregnancy test, where the user is instructed to inspect the \"result window\" to determine the outcome.\n\nIn the context of culture, there is no specific mention of the term \"signs.\" However, the concept of \"signs\" is implied in the context of the patient's symptoms, where the doctor is trying to determine the underlying cause of the patient's physical and behavioral changes.",

Once the time has passed, the user should inspect the \"result window.\" If a line or plus symbol appears, you are pregnant. It does not matter how faint the line is. A line, whether bold or faint, means the result is positive. Most tests also have a \"control indicator\" in the result window. This line or symbol shows whether the test is working or not. If the control indicator does not appear, the test is not working properly. You should not rely on any results from a faulty kit.",

These can be caused mostly by nutritional problems like vitamin b12, b6 deficiency and many other causes. Most common for you with anemia would be to rule out b12 def. Please get a complete blood workup done along with serum b12 levels to rule out this as a cause. Then we can think about other causes. I hope this helps. I wish you super healthy life ahead.

Isnt there a blood test to tell if you have cancer? I am diabeticHi, It is very important to detect cancer early when it is still curable. However, none of the tests you have mentioned is for cancer. Unfortunately, the answer to your cancer is not that simple. Cancer is a disease that can be presented in various types and can arise in any body part. Depending upon the type of cancer, there are different tests available for early detection, however, there is no one test, that can detect all types of cancer with certainty. For example, for breast cancer - tests like mammography (special types of x-rays of breasts) can help in detection. For Lung cancer - tests like CT scan can help. For Prostate cancer - blood test like PSA can give clues. For head and neck cancer - a simple examination by a doctor can help in detection. Thus, for every cancer, we have a different test for its detection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",
        "I have been diagnosed with asthmatic bronchitis after having a cold . When reading up on this illness I realized it is sometimes misdiagnosed and could be lung cancer . I am 25 and have smoked for 10 years on and off and I smoke less than 1/4 pack a day. What is the most effective monitoring of symptom to look out for or screening test to check for early stages of lung cancer?Hello, There are several signs that are sometimes obvious that a malignancy is brewing such as constant cough, sputum mixed with blood, weight loss (very important), GI symptoms such as vomiting or constant sickness. Getting a chest X-Ray is the first investigation, but HRCT is more sensitive and can be done. The most important thing you must do is STOP smoking, and it does not matter if it is 1 or 20 cigarettes a day. Asthma/COPD is the obvious progression of lung pathology is you continue and finally ends up with cancer in some people. There is no reliable blood test for lung cancer as is there for some other organ-specific cancers so do STOP smoking. Thanks.",

Highly suspicious common symptoms of cancer are a swelling that is painful or painless of recent appearance and growing fast, cough that cannot be explained, fever, loss of weight, generalized weakness, vomiting, blood in stools, sudden change in bowel habit. If you want to get peace of mind concerning you having cancer then please approach a cancer screening clinic at any cancer hospital and inform them about cancer history in your family and smoking history and get the important relevant cancer screening tests done.",

Potential of traditional medicine (TM) is not realized in the society, because although there is a sense of belief BUT no sense of relief.2. TM is disappearing/loosing due to cultural changes and declining access.3. Importantly making of medicine through TM way requires long distance travel which require transport and operational cost and finances resulting in replacement of them by different concoctions, tinctures and powdered form.4. Destruction of forests where native people have lived for years and gained knowledge about various plants and species has resulted in disappearance of information.5.

Everyone is money mad. I would never ask for money to help someone even though as poor as I am.**1. Since blood tests require specific reagent to show whether the levels of different substances in your blood fall within a normal range, thus they can help you and your doctor learn more about your health and can help find potential problems early, when treatments or lifestyle changes may work best, but blood tests alone cannot be used to diagnose certain medical problems.2. Blood tests allow a doctor/physician to see a detailed analysis of any disease markers, the nutrients and waste products in your blood as well as how various organs (e.g., kidneys and liver) are functioning, so if examination or history doesn't reveal much about patient ailment thus laboratory tests are tools helpful in evaluating the health status of an individual3.  Since the most common tests are done using a blood sample, or with use of portable machines thus search in your area where the rates are low.",

        "I was told that I am in the early stages of emphysema this week at the VA hospital where I go for various treatments, I also did not do very well on the exhaling portion of the breathing test I took for them. I am 72 years old and have been smoking off and on for approx. 40 years. The last startup,after a 12 year break, was 9 years ago after my wife passed away. CURRENTLY I DON T SMOKE A LOT ,5 A DAY. What is your best estimate for how long I have left?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Emphysema is an older term. Nowadays COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) term is used. It includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. And COPD is progressive disease. We have to manage it to halt the progression of the disease. So better term for COPD is chronic manageable disease. Lifelong treatment is needed. And for this you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST) to know the exact severity of the disease.  As treatment of COPD is based on severity of it. You need to follow below-mentioned steps simultaneously for effective treatment. 1. Quit smoking as soon as possible. 2. Start inhaled bronchodilators3. Enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise are done. 4. Get done vaccination with pneumococcal and influenza vaccines for prevention of future lung infections. If you strictly follow these life expectancy will be very good.",
        "Hello I am almost 18 years old and I think I may have COPD because I feel short of breath. It all happened at a friends house about 5 years ago and suddenly when I came home an hour later I lost my voice and got a chest infection. then It never stopped I still feel short of breath. Back then all my friends parents pretty much smoked. Ive had this for a long time. I do not feel fatigued or had any chest pains. I went over there everyday after school. Stayed for a few hours and left. Will I die? I m rather worried.Hi COPD/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has 2 main forms: emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema occurs when there is enlargement of air spaces due to destruction of the walls of some air passages in the lung. Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed if the person has a productive cough for at least 3 months in each 2 consecutive years with all other causes having been excluded. (You would need to have a mucus producing cough for 3 myths out of each of the last 2 yrs). Symptoms may include productive cough, breathlessness and wheezing. It is diagnosed based on history of smoke exposure and symptoms, physical examination. Blood test and imaging studies will need to be done if it is suspected by your doctor. COPD is not normally seen in young persons There are other causes of shortness of breath and your doctor will check for these. They include: anemia, asthma, lung infections, heart disease, inflammation of the lung, blockage of the upper airway such as the nose. You need to see you doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms I hope this information is helpful to you",
        "my mum has emphysema. she has had 4 times in last month or so she has been taken to A & E. each time they cant do a lot. say she has chest infection and give her steroids and anti biotics. She doesnt have oxygen as her levels are fine. we went to chest clinic this week and she breathed in tubes for the nurse before we went to see professor in chest clinic. He said to her to carry on using her 3 different inhalers and nebuliser. I asked how her breathing was and he said very bad. He said she had bronchitis and will get it over and over again. They dont explain much really. She is not eating properly and i am trying to get her to eat small portions often. She has extremely sore throat after taking steroids, a sore mouth and teeth and she is very thin. I am just wondering how far advanced she is with this disease as nobody seems to say anything. I know they cant say really, they just said she will carry on getting infections and it wont get better, which i know already. Is there stages in the disease i need to know about. Is she in a bad way etc?Hello Thank you for asking. There are a lot of patients with This complains that I see in my everyday routine. From your information I can give you some helpful data. Emphysema of the lungs combined with chronic bronchitis represent a single lung diseases called COPD. In some patients it is the emphysema symptoms with dyspnea that predominates not bronchitis and in some others is bronchitis with cough and sputum. COPD is a chronic lung diseases mostly in smokers or ex smokers, or in patients suffered for a long time from uncontrolled asthma or asthma not treated or in patients that live or work for a long time in dirty environment. To determine the diagnosis of COPD it will be done a test called SPiROMETRY with bronchodilator. If the test is positiver than the next step is to define the grade(stage) of the diseases. There are four grades A, B,C, D. According to the grades it is the treatment. But I also recommend a cardiologist consult because in most cases COPD is associated with cardiac diseases. I wish you good healthThank you Chat Doctor. ",

The mucus that I bring up is thick and dark green (sorry for the gruesome details) I seem to have a constant headache and feel constantly tired.Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor Productive cough may be related to bronchitis. Viral bronchitis is more common than bacterial bronchitis. These infections may be associated with additional symptoms such as headaches, fatigue. Additional symptoms such as ear ache, sore throat, decreased appetite. You may want to consider the use of bucolic agents. These would help to reduce the thickness of the secretions so that it can be expelled easier. Examples are bipolar, guaifenesin, Mucomyst use of an analgesic would help with the headache. Paracetamol can be used. Rest and the use of enough fluids would also be important. I hope this helps",

The fact that you are noting sputum means that this is the most likely cause for you. This can be treated with oral anti histamines and topical steroid nasal sprays. In most cases it is caused by an allergen. If this can be identified and exposure reduced then symptoms should also reduce.(2)HERD- gastroesophageal reflux is also a common cause.

I can be doing absolutely nothing and have trouble breathing, sometimes waking me up at night. Help?Hello, Airway closure and inflammation are the most common reasons for a persistent cough with infection. You may need a short course of oral steroids to help reduce the inflammation in the chest. Continued inflammation is often the most common reason for the persistent coughing. You may also need to use a medicine to open the airways, either an oral medicine or the temporary use of an inhaler such as Ventolin. Hope I have answered your query.

The cough is slightly productive, more like having to clear my throat and I feel more tired then I should.

I cough more in the morning and after I eat. I am able to do my zumba classes with SOB or coughing. Any ideas?Hi and thanks for the query, It is imperative to know the cause of the cough. Your medical history deserves a formal exclusion of active HERD. Gastric fluid if inhaled and could cause inflammation of the lungs causing a chronic cough. Heart failure could also present as such. A cardiac ultrasound, chest X-ray, microscopes from your gastroenterologist could be of immense help. Thanks and kind regards."

The locking and clicking of the joint could be because of the bruise leading to disc displacement in the Temporomandibular joint. The other possible cause can be because of malocclusion, which results in abnormal forces over the joint. Consult an oral physician and get it diagnosed.  You can take anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  You can also take muscle relaxants like chlorzoxazone. Furthermore, you can give hot fomentation over the joints. Do not eat hard things, do not open your mouth too wide. Take soft diet.

        "i am mrs tapanita chatterjee, 30 yrs. i am suffering from hyper mobility joint. now i have severe pain in every joint of body. and it happens after 7 to 8 months gapping .it stayed for 20 to 25 days.rehumatologist suggested for phisiotheraphy. what will be the future effect of it? may i become invalid?Hello, As mentioned in the history of the hypermobility of the joints, I think you need to work on with the physio to focus on the joint stability exercise and weight-bearing.  This will be low intensity and high energy consumption exercises. But effective for sure. Research supports the effect of physio in cases with hypermobility of the joint with using the right pattern of the exercise implementation and joint stability. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most hypermobility joints have responded well to stability, strengthening and controlled movements exercises. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In Chat Doctor. "

        "Hi and thanks, My jaw has tried lock up on me 5 or 6 times today. It all of a sudden starts pulling strongly to the left or right and wont give give up for a minute or two. It s a rather scary feeling. Not on any medication. I can get it to go into that mode by pushing my lower jaw outward sometimes. It s happened a few other times in my life I can recall, but not as often as it s been happening today. I m 62.Hello, Locking of jaw along with pulling sensation can be due to causes like muscle spasms, jaw joint dislocation, temporomandibular joint or temporomandibular disorders' etcetera. You should consult an oral surgeon and get evaluated, and a clinical examination and a panoramic x-ray should be done to rule out the exact cause of the symptoms. For now, you can take muscle relaxants like Chlorzoxazone and do warm compresses over the jaw. Massage the sides of a jaw with gentle movements of fingertips. Take soft meals and avoid opening the mouth too wide. Avoid stress. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  ",
        "This never has happened before. But my jaw has been locking up. It has happened a couple times but then passes away. But these past months it has been happening frequently. My jaw on the right side has locked up and once I try to open my mouth its in pain but then eventually makes a pop noise. Once I close my mouth back into its original postiotion it gets locked back up in place. It usually stops after a while but it never has lasted this long. What is going on and how can it be unlocked?Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor forum, I would like you to know that lock jaw condition has a number of reasons to it, stress is one of them. Jaw problems can be hereditary too, in order to treat the condition we have to rule out the cause. I would like to advise you to kindly see your dentist soon. Until then follow a soft diet, try not to open your mouth too wide while yawning. Perform jaw muscle exercises. Do not worry, believe in your dentist and follow the instructions as given hope this answer was useful. I wish you good health. Take care",
        "hello i have my jaw on the left hand side has been locked now for 5 weeks and i dont know what to do i am currrently experianceing tremendous pain in my jaw, in my neck and in my head all on the left hand side, i have seen the doctors who told me to the dentist and my dentist telling me to see the doctor please help! thanksHi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that you are suffering from Erasmus also known as Lock jaw, and it is a symptom of some underlying disease or problem and is not a disease on its own. It can occur due to a number of causes like traumatic injury to the jaw joint, jaw joint disorders, dental infections, nerve related disorders, oral submucous fibrosis, TMJ/TMD etc. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated, and he can advise you investigations like Orthopantomogram that is a full mouth x-ray, MRI scan etc. to rule out the exact cause of problem and treatment can be done accordingly. As of now you can start taking anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen, muscle relaxant like Chlorzoxasone, do warm compresses and take a soft diet. Avoid excessive training to open mouth. Avoid stress as it can add up to your problem. Take proper rest. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. ",
        "Hi Doctor,I had lockjaw on Saturday night. This was 5th time in last 5 yrs I had loackjaw. But this time it took about 5 hrs to come back to normal, that too after orthopedist actually fixed it by applying some pressure to cause required movement of my lower jaw to get it into right groove. Since, this time it was very hard and long trouble, I would like to know possible causes of this. Please not that I dont have any ailment/disease, except that I get allergy and infection in my throat very quickly and keep taking Mondeslor tablets and Foracort puff.Kindly advice on possible causes, ways to diagnose/narrow-down to real cause and any exercise/treatment which can fix it.  Thanks,BhumeshwarHello, Welcome Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query, as you have said that you have lock jaw problem it can be due to if you undergone any dental treatment, Lock Jaw is known as Erasmus which is due to Master muscle spasm, It can be due to many cause like Tetanus, or due to stress also or may be due to Temporomandibular disorder also, so don't take so much stress do proper exercises, Hope this will help you, Wish you good health"

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, here are some examples of how hypertrophy manifests in biological systems and the underlying mechanisms and factors that contribute to its development:\n\n1. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the heart: \n- LVH is defined as the increase in muscle mass of the left ventricle.\n- It can be caused by age, intensive sports practice, obesity, or prolonged hypertension.\n- The seriousness of hypertension arises from its impact on the heart, leading to an increase in oxygen consumption by the heart muscle, and potentially causing ventricular rhythm disturbances and poor revascularization of the deep layers of the myocardium.\n\n2. Hypertrophy in the endometrium:\n- Endometrial hypertrophy is mentioned in the context of a 50-year-old woman with a history of hyperplasia of the endometrium.\n- Estrogen plays a role in endometrial hyperplasia, and there is a mention of the adrenal gland and other sites of the body secreting estrogen.\n\n3. Hypertrophy in the ventricles:\n- Ventricle hypertrophy means the heart is enlarged.\n- It can be caused by hypertension, aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, or other reasons.\n- The left ventricle can be hypertrophied, or it can be both ventricles.\n- Hypertrophy usually does not cause symptoms unless it interferes with cardiac output (CO).\n\nThese examples illustrate how hypertrophy can manifest in different biological systems, such as the heart and endometrium, and the underlying mechanisms and factors that contribute to its development.",

The diagnosis is suspected on the ECG and confirmed by ultrasound. Among the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy are age, intensive practice of one or more sports, obesity, prolonged hypertension. The seriousness of hypertension arises from its impact on a number of organs (target organs). The complications that can develop at their level explain the increased morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. The heart is one of the main target organs, and one of the first consequences of elevated blood pressure (PA) is left ventricular hypertrophy (HVG). The heart adapts to high blood pressure by increasing the volume, resulting in an increase in oxygen consumption by the heart muscle. As a result, coronary revascularization may gradually become insufficient. Progressively, the diastolic function (see DIASTOLE) then systolic (see SYSTOLE) will alter. In addition, this increase in volume of the left ventricle may cause ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extrasystole for example) and poor revascularization of the deep layers of the myocardium (risk of INFARCTS). I advise you not to stop your antihypertensive treatment (keep it for life)To practice a hygiene of life with especially a diet without salt (look at the dash or dietary approach to stop hypertension see https://www.yyyyyyyyy.yyyyyy.gov/yyyyyyy/yyyyyy/public/heart/hbp_low.pdf)Walking every day (45 minutes per 24 hours)And consult your cardio as quickly as possible. May this informations help you best wishes",

Ventricle hyper trophy mean your heart is enlarged .iv can be many reasons like in case of Hypertension, aortic stenosis, pulmonary Hypertension n so on. There are 2 ventricles left n right . It can be both ventricle hypertrophic n can be only one side.when hypertrophy occur usually do not cause any symptom of it is not interfering with CO. Due to right ventricle enlarge my patient some time having feeling of throwing in chest... if u were my patient I would like to run some test like echo chest X-ray, so I can find the cause n that causing hypertrophy n treat it accordingly hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.

        "Hi,I am a 42yr old female recently found out I have an enlarged heart. What s shocking is I have always exercised and worked out regularly from as early as age 16. I do not abuse alcohol nor have I ever abused drugs, in the past my blood pressure has always been on the lower side, also low blood count . I guess i am just confused as to how this is now my situation.I am sorry I really can t afford to pay at this time for the answer. I was mistaken, I thought it was free advice.Thank you for your time though.SCHello.First enlarge heart is a very vague terminology. Size of hear increases in two fashion. One is increase in thickness of wall called Hypertrophy and other is increase in cavity of heart called Dilatation. Again Hypertrophy is subdivided into two types inward enlargement called concentric hypertrophy of heart and another is outward enlargement of heart called eccentric hypertrophy. Whereas Dilatation of heart is called Cardiomyopathy. And Cardiomyopathy has various subtypes depending on etiology In short, the enlargement of heart including Hypertrophies and Cardiomyopathy; in both cases, the cause is not sure always. Any person at any age of life can be developed these disease. So in my opinion, better to go for diagnosis of which type of heart disease you are suffering and up to what extent having this disease then start the treatment that depends on condition and etiology. Thank You",
        "i want to ask you doctor awoman has 50 years old and she had ahyperatrophy of the endometrium a pathological examination was done after surgical removal of the endompetrium and the endometrium was completely benign and ther was no atypia by the way i am adentist and iread that women after the age of 50 the have hyperatrophy of the endometrium because of estrogen secreted from the adrenal gland and some other sites of the body 2 weeks after surgery the thickness of the endometrium is 12 cm (thick) i think should this woman be given progestrone hormone to prevent the hyperatrophy she was given tamoxifen drug for breast cancer treatment for 6 years but ithink that there is no relathionship between tamoxifen and hyperatrophy because she did not use tamoxifen since 1 year after the curetage surgery why there is ahyoeratrophy (12 cm) what is your opinion by the way i am adentist and ihave some informations about gynecology and woman hormonesHi, Endometrial hyperplasia and hypertrophy is somewhat different anyway the exact histopathological diagnosis is preferable. Estrogen plays a role in endometrial hyperplasia. Breast cancer patient should have an annual gynecological check up to rule out the same. The clinical trials like ATC, ATLAS has reported about it. But chance of malignancy is less. So you should better follow the normal breast cancer follow-up protocol."

        "Hello my 10 month old child has a dark purple line around his lips, like he wearing lip liner. He keeps getting a temp of over 38 and has a panful chesty cough and wheeze.  Do you know why he has that? His oxygen levels are fine, got them tested today at the doctors.Hi, If I were your treating Doctor for this case of severe pain under the left rib cage, I would come up with three possibilities, these include:1. Anemia is one of the common causes of lip discoloration. It is often related to iron-deficiency anemia, but any type of anemia can be responsible.  Hemoglobin is responsible for the naturally red color of blood. A deficiency of hemoglobin or red blood cells will affect the lip color accordingly. In severe cases this discoloration may be slightly blue and becomes more pronounced with cold weather.2. Cyanosis associated with a higher than normal level of deoxygenated blood. This can be caused by any number of pulmonary diseases as obstructive bronchitis, pneumonia. Emergency medical attention is necessary if blue or purple lips are associated with a diminished level of consciousness, cold and clammy skin and difficulty breathing. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing your baby good health.",
        "sometimes the veins in my lips turn blue(especially lower lip). I am a healthy 49 years of age. I had my dr check it out (lips were not blue at that time). He listened to my lungs/heart /checked my circulation. He could not find a problem. I do have anemia and take daily iron supplements. I also take a proton pump inhibitor every day + pill for my Hashimotos disease.  I am eating healthy and exercising regularly. I am baffled as to what is causing this. It bugs me.Hi I did read your query and concern. It seems that you might be experiencing episodes of cyanosis in which bluing of lips occur. Most commonly it is due to a heart problem or a lung problem or a circulation problem. However, if all of these are normal, there is a condition known as methemoglobinemia caused by many genetic hemoglobin types. Does anyone in your family have the same problem? You can get it checked by an expert hematologist or if the symptoms do not cause any problems to you, you can send the blood sample overseas to Chat Doctor. Hope this help swish you a super healthy life ahead do let me know if you have any more questions for me.",
        "Hi my mother has parkinson disease/ dementia and heart failure she has recently been complaining of a spongy feeling under foot. Also she has had at least four occasions in which she struggles to breath turns blue around the lips becomes very weak and wets herself. I have reported this to our local GP and her mental health team all of whom seem puzzled she is due to see her neurologist next month but today she has said she is getting a very cold feeling down her body and a feeling of fluid trickling in her headHis understand your concern. Blue lips mean cyanosis and cyanosis need to evaluate in detail. Blue lips plus she struggles in breathing then respiratory illness or obstruction is most likely. Cynosis require immediate medical assistance. It is occurred due to decrease oxygen saturation in blood. So do consultation to physician as early as possible and get help. Take neurologist or psychiatrist opinion there after but 1st priority is to consult physician for medical problems. I hope I have answered your query. Thank you.",
        "my young infant developed red hot small swelling in her fingertips of hands and toes, she was admitted to hospital because she had got severe chest infection with blue lips. she received antibiotic injections for a week or so. she is now 10months old and she had recurrent chest infections and bilateral groin hernia...any help?Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor... Noted your infant is 10 month age and repeated chest infection with blue lip. When tissue not getting enough oxygenated blood then blue cyanosis can occur by deoxygenated blood or less blood supply. Here as he has repeated infection, so screening for immunodeficiency has to be look for by detail history and investigation. Keep his hogan proper ... Passive smoking avoided.... Here cardiac problem also has to be ruled out by doctor....If you need ECG or echo useful. Take care."

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the potential causes and implications of blue skin discoloration in various scenarios are:\n\n1. In the context of a 6-month-old baby (Cam):\n   - Blue skin discoloration could be due to a problem in the blood vessels or a problem in the heart that is unable to pump enough blood to different parts of the body. (From the context: \"blue colored skin means that there is not enough oxygenated blood supply reaching this area of skin.\")\n   - This needs a thorough examination by echocardiogram to exclude any chaotic heart disease.\n   - The baby's symptoms, such as blue hands and feet, especially during feeding or after waking up, could be related to a heart problem or a blood vessel issue.\n\n2. In the context of a 3-year-old child:\n   - Blue skin discoloration could be due to the lungs not getting enough oxygen, causing the blood to remain blue (cyanosis).\n   - The underlying blood is moving sluggishly, making the normal veins underneath more noticeable.\n\nIn both cases, the blue skin discoloration is a sign of a potential underlying medical issue, and a consultation with a pediatrician is recommended for further assessment and diagnosis.\n\nIn the context of skin discoloration in general, the provided context mentions various possible causes, including:\n\n* Sunlight-induced photo-pigmentation\n* Freckles and UV spots\n* Plasma\n* Seborrhea Melanesia\n* Addison pigmentation\n* Vitamin B12 deficiency\n* Acanthuses Nigerians\n* Internal causes of pigmentation\n\nThese causes may not be directly related to blue skin discoloration, but rather to general skin discoloration issues.",

        "Doctor I have some discoloration in my face and my face looks dull and dark compared to my body color. Though I took some mild peel sessions also. Iam regular in applying sunscreen during the day whether at home or outside. But I dont see much change in my face color. Ism a veg and I take lot of veg and fruits. Yet there is no glow in my face. Can u suggest some remedies. Ian planning to take some laser sessions for my face discoloration. Will it work for me...can u pl suggestHello, Welcome to Chat Doctor Discoloration of face is rather a broad term. It can include any hyperpigmented problems. The cause for your pigmentation has to be ascertained. A consultation with a dermatologist practicing cosmetology will help in diagnosis. Sunlight induced photo-pigmentation, freckles and UV spots, Plasma, Seborrhea Melanesia, Addison pigmentation, Vitamin B12 deficiency, acanthuses Nigerians etc. are all causes of pigmentation and needs to be ruled out. Please continue using sunscreen and re apply every 3-4 hours during the day. Your diet also seems to be fine. Chemical peels and microdermabrasion will help if you take many sittings provided you rule out internal causes of pigmentation. Hope this helpedTake care",
        "My son Cam is just about 6 mths old, and lately myself and others have been noticing his hands and feet turn blue ( cyanosis) and sometimes around his mouth. The majority of the time, it s while he s having a bottle, or just waking up. His hands and feet turn blue at bath time also, although I always warm up the house extra, and make sure his water his warm, even adding warm water as I go. When he was just two- days- old, I noticed his lips and around his nose were blue, so I called the nurse down to my room, and she told me he just needed to burp. After he did, he was still blue so she took him down and checked his vitals, and at that time all was fine, must have been gas she said. I have an appt made with his doctor for the 19th and but should I insist he be seen before then Also he was tested for Cystic Fibrosis when he was 1 mth due to a prolapsed rectum. He had the sweat chloride test done, and the tech who administered it said she thought she got enough sweat , when the doctor called with the results, he said he was in the clear based on the amount of the sample , but seemed hesitant, all at the same time. Do you know if it s possible for a sweat chloride test to be wrong? Also no matter where he s touched, regardless of pressure, his skin turn blotchy red.Hi, I understand your concerns, but blue colored skin means that there is not enough oxygenated blood supply reaching this area of skin. This could be due to a problem in the blood vessels or due to a problem in the heart that is unable to pump enough blood to different parts of the body. This needs a thorough examination by echocardiogram to exclude any chaotic heart disease. I recommend also to repeat the test for cystic fibrosis in another laboratory to make sure of the result. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

As a young girl I had a bad case of skin break out and the resulting outcome was dark discolourations on my legs which means it is totally disheartening since I can t wear a nice dress or skirt without a stocking of some type. I ve been to a dermatologist and nothing seems to really be working. Any suggestions?Hi there OXY. I hear your particular issues but skin discoloration is one of the most challenging conditions we handle in dermatology & cosmetology.  It is often not as gratifying & the treatment varies between different individuals, races & skin types. Dermatology is pretty much a visual field & as such, a good clear digital image would be helpful & you can do so using the upload data icon to the right of your screen on this site. Please also list all the medications you have used, durations etc. It is best in your case to present yourself to a dermatologist nearest you. Agreed, one particular line of management may not have suited you. Please do get a second opinion. Cheers & Good luck.  Chat Doctor. ",
        "hi, my daughter is 3 years old and her complesion is dark and it looks like bluish in color although me and my husband are very fair.someone told me that due to intake of hypothyroid medicine and iron suppliments her complexion is like this. Is it true? and is there any way i can lighten her complexion :(Thanks for asking via Chat Doctor, bluish color of skin is due to -The lungs are not getting enough oxygen. Since oxygen is what makes blood turn red, blood cells without oxygen remain blue (\"cyanosis\"). The underlying blood is moving sluggishly, so the normal veins underneath that carry blue, oxygen-poor blood back to the heart are more noticeable. Consult your pediatrician, get examined. If every thin is OK then do nothing at this age. Regards"

I can understand your concern. Your symptoms point towards either an underlying chronic depressive disorder or a dysthymia disorder which is a milder variant. You might also require assessment of your personality profile. Active suicidal thoughts are a psychiatric emergency. I suggest you undergo a thorough psychiatric evaluation as early as possible and get yourself admitted as an in-patient considering your suicidal thoughts. Effective anti-depressant medication and psychotherapy (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) are available for management. Hope you found the information useful. Regards Chat Doctor. ",

Scared and nervous I had my dad rush me to her apartment and she was just sitting there watching tv. After talking to her for a bit I found out she was suicidal and has had suicidal ideations for some time now. And my brother says its because of me and that she thinks I hate her. I comforted her as much as I could and when I felt she was calmed down I left. What should I do? My mom wants to take her own life because of me.Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  Suicidal ideation is normally an after effect of depression. Not clinical depression. Disappointment in life as unforeseen events take place can also trigger disappointment and usually leads to a depressive state for some time. Substance abuse can also lead to suicidal ideation and depression. Therefore, correct diagnosis is necessary. Consult a psychologist / psychiatrist for diagnosis and treatment. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck."

        "Hey, I am a young male that recently turned 20, my question is about facial hair, my facial hair seems to be growing slowly and I am just worried that, like a few people I know will only grow in certain patches and stop there, how old until my beard is fully grown, will acne prevent hair from growing on that spot, does acne cream stop hair growth because of the chemicals in it, do acne scars without a doubt mean a bald spot for my beard in that scar area. At what age should I expect full growth, also, I think I have noticed my beard growing sligthly quicker when I exercice, this beeing from the raise in testosterone I assume right? I know my questions are a little all over the place, I would really appreciate an asnwer to all of themHi Many, Welcome and thanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor. So you are worried about the growth of facial hair (rather beards) in uniform manner. Now to solve your queries:1. Our growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time. It all depends on the family pattern and genes which we carry from our ancestors. So, basically it will be depending on your parents side.2. Neither acne nor acne scars and creams prevent the growth of hair. None of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general. But if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face.3. Yes due to exercise we do have a bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth. Lastly there is no medical treatment in this world which can cause growth of hair in only beard area and your questions are exactly the same which a young man have (and even I had when I was at your age) so don't worry and be happy.With the best health and beard wishes, Chat Doctor.

        "hi sir i am using skin lite since 6months my face is looking gud if i apply it before day orelse it is looking black and i can see some hair growing on the face and upper lip, is that this hair problem on face is just becoz of this skin lite cream?Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor The hair growth is most likely due to usage of skin lite cream. Skinlite cream is a prescription product for pigmentation/plasma over face. Skin lite cream contains a potent steroid, mometasone. It should never be used on face for long because a potent steroid like mometasone can cause the skin of face to become photosensitive, Acne ridden and thinned out with telangiectasias. Females can also have facial hair growth (Hirsutism) which is an additional problem. I would suggest that you stop using this cream. Once stopped the hair growth would resolve gradually, may take up to 3-6 months to resolve. Regards",

        "Hi, I have 2 rings on my groin where the scrotum touches the leg, on the leg section. These are red on the outside and a yellowish/brown on the inside, and are about 1cm in diameter. My scrotum in the area that touches these rings is red and itchy. Its been there for about 5 days now and isnt disappearing, what could be the cause and solution?Hall, The fungus that most commonly causes JOCK ITCH is called TRICHOPHYTON QUORUM.  The rash of jock itch starts in the groin fold usually on both sides. If the rash advances, it usually advances down the inner thigh. The advancing edge is redder and more raised than areas that have been infected longer. The skin with in the border turns a reddish-brown and loses much of its scale.  Jock itch caused by T. Rubrum does not involve the scrotum or penis. If those areas involved, the most likely agent is Candida albicans, the same type of yeast that causes vaginal yeast infections. 1. Wear loose fitting clothing made of cotton or synthetic materials designed to wick moisture away from the surface.2. Avoid sharing clothing and towels or wash cloths.3. Allow the groin to Chat Doctor. 4. Antifungal powders or sprays may be used once a day to prevent infection.",

        "I have a disease called depersonalization disorder. I ve been stuck in it for the past year. It means a loss of identity or personality. For me it was induced by reading philosophical books and putting them into practice for a long time, basically saying that You are not your social identity, you are not who you think you are, you are not your mind or your thoughts... Bottom line I need my old self back, the one that I stupidly let go by brainwashing myself and meditating a lot. I try to get my old thinking patterns back, but the new reality I m stuck in keeps crawling back hard and I can t get rid of it. A friend of mine saw a psychiatrist specialized in Depersonalization, he was prescribed a combination of SSRI + Antipsychosis, and is doing somewhat better. I am very scared that the use of strong medications can give me even LESS control over my brain, and I already have very little control. I am also scared of the side effects, especially from CIpralex, which I am considering taking. Do you have any experience with this disease? And what do you advise me, thank you.Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. Depersonalization is an anomaly of self-awareness. Subjects feel they have changed, and the world has become vague, Chat Doctor. You did not mention significant symptoms related to depersonalization in your case history. You may have other psychological issues which need detailed evaluation to identify. If your psychiatrist want to start circle, let him. It does cause losing control over brain.",

In this there is apathy about everything, decreased initiation, disinterest in everything.... usually present with what u experiencing that people scaring u or always whispering about u.

        "For twenty years since I left a went scuba diving in connection with a cruise vacation, I have had daily problems with balance. Dr. Timothy Hain, Northwestern University, Chicago, seemed to believe I had a damaged vestibular system. One other doctor initially thought that I suffered with mal de dubarquement. Dr. Hain seemed to rule out this condition. What should I do in the way of trying to determine if anything can be done to alleviate my balance problems?Hello! I read your question and understand your concern.  I agree with your doctors that your balance problems may be related to the inner ear. But they also may be caused by the brain problems or vertebral artery narrowing. The long time you refer with these problems, is more indicating an inner ear problem.  Vestibular tests can diagnose disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and perilymph fistula, whicChatDoctormonly occur after head injury; and bilateral vestibular cytotoxicity, whicChatDoctormonly is a side effect of medication. I would recommend tests like electronystagmography, electrocochleography, rotational chair test, posturography, fistula test to find out a possible inner ear problem. A brain MRI may be needed if everything results normal. Hearing pathway tests (audiometry, auditory brain stem response, electrocardiography) can also be used for the same purpose, and are frequently combined with vestibular tests. After finding the cause of your problems than we can choose the right treatment. Hope to have been of help! Best wishes!",

Thanks, Jane! I didn t realize there would be a charge, my funds are limited, so I ll passDear Jane, The queries asked in this forum are answered free of cost. Please feel free to ask your questions. The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to pathology in the Vestibular Apparatus in inner ear (it is associated with maintenance of body posture & balance) most probably Labyrinthine or Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Vestibular sedatives like Betahistine or Linearizing preparations (to be taken only under the guidance of a Physician). If it still persists, then you need to consult your Physician/ ENT Specialist & get a complete clinical examination done. Investigations like estimation of blood pressure, blood sugar levels, serum electrolytes & vestibular function tests will be required to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.

This isnt the first time that I have been diagnosed with lupus. I was first diagnosed at the age of 21, they called in RA and OA specialist and all that. Now at the age of 32, lupus is back in the picture. Why tell me not to worry, cause there isnt anything to worry about, but its on papers that I am positive to have lupus. The SS ppl got the paper from the doctors right? And I have all manners of autoimmune diseases from Sarcoidosis, fibromyalgia, neuropathy, sciatic nerve damage, high blood pressure, thyroid cists, carpal tunnel, mental issues, just to name a few. But why is the question and how do I truly know, besides all the pain?Hi ! Thank you for your query. Dear madam, Well SHE is a multisystem disease, you can well have neuropathy and hypertension in this. The presentation depends on which systems have been involved by the disease. SHE can have varied presentation fever, malaise, joint pains, myalgic, fatigue, skin rash specially in the face , photosensitivity, recurrent abortions etc. The most common test for establishing the diagnosis is ANA, if it is positive in greater than 1:320 title then it is very likely that you have SHE Other more specific tests include Anti DS DNA and Anti Sm antibodies. I advise you to consult a rheumatologist to carry out your detailed evaluation and the specific tests which are necessary for establishing the diagnosis and assessing the disease activity by ESR, CRP etc. Hope you are satisfied with the answer. If you have any further queries feel free to ask. Wish you good health. Take care.",

        "what causes kidney failure?any idea?Kidney failure can occur from an acute situation or from chronic problems. In acute renal failure, kidney function is lost rapidly and can occur from a variety of insults to the body. The list of causes is often categorized based on where the injury has occurred. Prerenal causes (pre=before + renal=kidney) causes are due to decreased blood supply to the kidney. Examples of prerenal causes are: * Hypokalemia (low blood volume) due to blood loss * Deny Chat Doctor.  * Loss of blood supply to the kidney due to obstruction of the renal artery or vein. Renal causes (damage directly to the kidney itself) include: * Sepsis: The bodies immune system is overwhelmed from infection and causes inflammation and shutdown of the kidneys. This usually does not occur with urinary tract infections.  * Medical",

He was recently diagnosed with infection in both kidneys. His heart and lungs and prostate was fine. Can you please tell me what you think could possibly be the problem?In my opinion it's not inflammation its swelling in legs, ankles and penile area you want to say. The function of our kidneys is to clear our body from toxic material produced and prevent blood sugar and proteins to pass in urine. In case of some kidney diseases and infection kidneys loose these functions and proteins are lost in urine resulting in decreasing body proteins and disturbance in body fluid balance. That is the reason fluid accumulates in body specially dependent areas like legs ankles. Don't worry this will improve after starting medications.",

Signs and symptoms of a fracture are: intense pain and tenderness, swelling, deformity of the bone involved, limitation of movementNormally for soft tissue injuries with no bony involvement, the following is suggested: R.I.C.E where r : rest, needs to rest , (2) I: ice, (3) C:in the presence of swelling, a compression bandage can be helpful to reduce the swelling and pain (4) elevation of the limb is also usefulAnti- inflammatory pain medication can also be used, on a full stomach.

Its been about a month and there is bruising that spread from the impact and its continuing to spread down to my ankles its very painful should i be worried?Cannot say in your particular case, but fractures can heal wrong and disrupt normal functioning. Haven't had all that many problems in long bones that stay straight even with fractures. Then, pain can be from various causes. Going outward from an injury may imply a (very small) nerve is irritated. This could be permanent. On the other hand low doses of cheap nerve dampers like anti-epileptics or even topical lidocaine are very, very effective.",

Recently I have been experiencing the nerves jumping in my legs for most of the night, resulting in lack of sleep and discomfort. Is there anything I can do to help this situation? I am normally an upbeat person but am beginning to feel a little anxious.Hi, If only the leg with fracture is affected, symptoms are related to the local damage (swelling, changes in blood circulation, etc.). If both legs are affected, you should be checked about spinal injuries, since you had a skiing accident. At least, an x-ray of your spine may give valuable information, even to exclude any traumatic damage to your spine. Discuss with your Doctor about these issues. Hope I have answered your query.

I can understand your concern. You have history of trauma.  So there is high chance of injuries.  Fracture causes pain, swelling, inflammation, restriction in movement etc. You should go for x-ray of injured part.  It will give you exact idea whether you have fracture or not.

I can understand your concerns. Enterobacter cloacae is a member of the normal gut flora of many humans and is not usually a primary pathogen. In other words, it is a communal or friendly organism having a symbiotic relationship in which one organism derives benefit while causing little or no harm to the others. Few healthy humans are colonized, but the percentage increases significantly with long term care facility residence or hospitalization. Colonization is an important prelude to infection. Individuals who have previously received antibiotic treatment, have comorbid disease, and are being treated in ICUs are at greatest risk for infection. Since you are otherwise healthy, you are unlikely to get any infection, even if this organism has grown on your toothbrush Regards ",

These are development based behavior issues. What is his age now? The given incidents alone seldom trigger the inferiority complex or emotional trauma. There could be something else which determined his behavior disorder, if there is one. The approach by others in the class and parents and teachers might have decided the issue. Even though, the child is capable enough to overcome the trauma because of his own developmental stage. Just motivation and appreciation was needed. There could be some faulty handling of the issue. In any case, I would advise you to consult a child psychologist to know exactly the reason and for further behavioral therapy. Therapy will be according to his age. You have not mentioned his age now, and therefore you should consult a psychologist. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

        "I have been using steroid scalp application for my psoriasis for many years by now and this is the only medication that seems to be working on my condition. I only apply it when redness and itchiness occur. I have learned lately that using this type of medication which contains steroids may have serious side effects such as the effect on normal production of steroids in the body. What would that exactly mean? What are the symptoms in such cases? Does it have anything to do with metabolism or overweight issues?Generally topical steroids side effects are present at the site where they are applied such as thinning of the skin, easy bruising, skin infection, etc. Topical steroids are likely to be absorbed through the skin into the body and cause side effects similar to oral steroids, especially if they are used continuously for long period on large areas of the body such as the back.

        "MRI scan report says central canal stenosis appears to be most severe at L3/4 in comparison to the degree and severity at L4/5.

Have problems peeing and now use ISC and take mixture of 25 analgesics a day plus oramorph 2 hourly if needed and am still in pain if I stand for a few minutes or walk 50 yards. Can you suggest alternative treatment. Do I need to get second opinion?Hello. Thanks for asking from Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. The canal stenosis at L3/4 and L4/5 involves nerves which supply urinary bladder, bowel, leg and foot. Your symptoms are due to compression of these nerves. You can take second opinion for evaluation of your symptoms and can get tests done for nerve function evaluation like nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and electromyography (EMG). This will help in confirming diagnosis. Coming to the treatment of lumbar canal stenosis, it can be treated by: Medical treatment like painkillers which you are already taking.  Surgical decompression of spine by removing bone and thick ligaments compressing nerves like laminectomy or rhinoplasty. It is done if medical treatment fails, compression leads to focal deficit. You can discuss it with your doctor. Hope it will help you. Thanks. Take care.",

I have gone through your query and understand your concern. You are suffering from Lumbar spinal canal stenosis. This is most commonly due to age related degeneration of tissues like cartilage and discs. It is usually associated with lumbar spondylosis. Spondylosis nothing but which is a defect or fracture on one or both of the wing-shaped parts of a vertebra. This lead to sliding of the vertebra over the lower vertebra and compressing the nerve root. This results in spinal canal narrowing. This may cause MySpace and pain in the supplying nerve root area.Thus, patient is having pain in lower back and left thigh and hip area.1. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen may help relieve pain symptoms.2. Flexing the spine by leaning forward while walking relieves their symptoms. 3. Lying with the knees Chat Doctor. 4. Rest, aerobic activities may provide relief. Gradual resumption of work after rest is usually recommended. Surgery is the final option to release the nerve root and increase the spinal space. Hope this helps. Please reply for further queries. Wishing you good health.",

Also My nose is plugged and I can t breathe out of my nose. Do you think it is just a cold or something severe? I have not ever had mucus come out of my eyes with a cold Then again I just moved to Illinois from Arizona and the winter is harsh so it might just be severe allergies. Also what medications should I take?Hi, Thanks for posting your query. You are most likely suffering from Acute Viral pharyngitis with conjunctivitis along secondary bacterial infection.

Allergic rhinitis (of the nasal passages), allergic sinusitis (of the sinuses) can cause increased mucus production. You may want to continue the use of any oral antihistamine and topical steroid nasal spray to see if this helps. It may take 2 to 3 weeks for an effect in some cases. The use of a bucolic may also be helpful. This is medication to help break up the mucus. I hope this helps",

        "Hi, my question is I had a bad infection from I think my swimming pool. And I was sick for a few weeks. And my research has lead me to believe that it was legionella bacteria that infected me. What are the symptoms from this type of infection? As it was exactly 1 year ago that I contracted this disease. I am a lot better now,but I will not swim in a pool ever again,because in Florida it s always hot and humid and the water is easy pray to parasites. Thanks from Mike YYYY@YYYYHello, The symptoms of bacterial infections depend upon the mode of transmission or spread such as:1. Airborne (coughing and sneezing)2. Contact with infected people, especially through kissing and sex.3. Contact with contaminated surfaces, food, and water.4. Contact with infected creatures, including pets, livestock, and insects such as fleas and ticks. However, the most common symptoms of bacterial infection include fever, coughing, headache, inflammation, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, burning micturition, foul smell vaginal discharge, etcetera. Legionnaires disease is caused by a bacterium known as Legionella. Its symptoms usually develop two to ten days after exposure to Legionella bacteria and include headache, muscle pain, and fever with chills. By the second or third day the signs and symptoms that may include cough which may bring up mucus and sometimes blood, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Confusion or other mental changes appear later. Although Legionnaires disease primarily affects the lungs, it occasionally can cause infections in wounds and in other parts of the body, including the heart. The most commonly reported infection from the swimming pool users is diarrhea which can be caused by Cryptosporidium, Guardian, Shell, Norovirus, and E. coli. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  ",

Any info much appreciated.         concerned Mom YYYY@YYYYHi Concerned Mom. Thanks for the query and history. The waterborne diseases are caused by the water source she is using.

        "Hello. About 3-4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with pneumonia. After two weeks I felt well enough to start getting back out, but I continued to cough up mucus. I got in the swimming pool last night and it was an outdoor pool and kind of cool. this morning I woke up with fever, wheezing bad and my back in my lung area hurts so bad. The coughing is getting worse too. Could the pneumonia have came back or never left? What should I do?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Swimming pool water is full of organisms. So possibility of relapse of pneumonia is more likely because your symptoms, coughing, wheezing, chest pain are more suggestive of pneumonia. So consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x-ray. If chest x-ray is showing fresh infiltrates then you will need another course of antibiotics, bucolic and expectorant Chat Doctor.  Avoid swimming for at least 1 month. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",
        "hi, suffering from aching back and neck, headache all over, sinusitis symptoms....hard to breathe especially at night.....2nd bout in 2 months.....debilitating because of tiredness .......I have been swimming in chlorinated indoor pool for 5 consecutive days leading up to this bout......would this trigger the bout and would antibiotics work?Hi, From history it seems that you might be having acute respiratory tract infection giving rise generalized body ache, malaise, headache, fatigue. Swimming in chlorinated water might have precipitated the infection. A course of antibiotic for 5 days will give good relief from your all symptoms as it will clear the infection.Meanwhile, take Ibuprofen, paracetamol combination and decongestant to give you symptomatic relief from all symptoms. Take plenty of water. Take complete rest. Ok and take care."

Then Friday there was a sign about high chlorine levels. Could the chlorine be the reason my mouth is irritated?Hello thanks for consulting at Chat Doctor. Adding more chlorine to pools with unbalanced pH further degrades the quality of the pool water. Highly acidic pool water can erode dental enamel. Team swimmers most often experience this damage; the more hours spent in the pool, the greater the effects of chronic exposure to acidic water.

In my opinion, you are mostly having allergic skin lesions due to chlorinated water exposure. Possibility of sun related skin changes are less. As sun exposure causes blackening of skin. Chlorine is very well known skin allergen. And it is used as disinfectant in swimming pool water. So susceptible individuals, on exposure to chlorinated water can develop allergic skin lesions. So better to avoid swimming pool for few days. Start antihistamine and anti-allergic Chat Doctor.  Apply steroid containing cream on affected skin areas. Since all these ",

She has been previously diagnosed with Symptimatic Asthma but has not had to take her inhalers on a regular basis yet. Do you think she could be having a reaction to the chlorine at the swimming pools? Or is this a normal reaction for people with asthma?Hi, Your daughter has an allergic diaeresis i.e. she is prone to develop allergy to various allergen and that's how she has been diagnosed asthma in the past. Similarly, when she enters the pool, she is reacting to various allergens that may be present in the pool including the chlorine and the cold water. You must ensure that the [pool she is using has good standard of hygiene and is cleaned regularly. You may try putting her on some inhalers like airport or Aeroflot and a tablet of montelukast for 3 to 5 days and then take her to the pool.

One of the causes of elevated alkaline phosphatase is obstruction to the bile flow. This obstruction could be either inside the liver substance or in the bile duct. In these cases the liver panel would be abnormal. There would be a raise in the bilirubin level especially the direct component. An ultrasound scan may show dilated bile ducts. If the obstruction is inside the liver substance the ultrasound scan may not show it and a liver biopsy may have to be done to confirm it. This obstruction could be harmless as in gallstones in the bile duct or may indicate serious conditions like malignancy, primary biliary cirrhosis etc. There are other causes of high alkaline phosphatase also. Bone disease can cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase level. Pregnancy can cause a raise in alkaline phosphatase. Is this answer helpful?"

As far as management is concerned, first thing is cause of acute pancreatitis is it a GALL STONES?  Or something is else.  Second is how severe is the attack? For this we need to get some investigations like serum glucose, BBC, LDH and AST along with UREA CREATININE and serum CALCIUM LEVELS.

All necessary fluids have to be given via intravenous route along with ANTIBIOTICS. Studies have shown that EMINEM has reduced the mortality by 70% in these patients.  My advice to you, you should meet GASTROENTEROLOGIST so that you can be counselled properly. As far as home management for this disease is concerned I will discourage you for it and in my opinion patient should be hospitalized until and unless he starts tolerating oral diet... meanwhile stay calm and meet your GASTROENTEROLOGIST.get well soon Hope your query is adequately ad Chat Doctor.

Even though you can move your arm, still there are some conditions that you can have some range of motion but not complete one.

Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness(LOC) for a few minutes, loss of consciousness for 2-3 hours does not appear to be due to syncope. It would be prudent to rule out any cardiac arrhythmias by getting a 24 hour Holder testing(Mobile ECG) to rule out any bradyarrhythmias or abnormalities of rhythm and rate. A EEG, other causes of LOC need to be looked for, this includes seizures, TIA and other cause. Syncope needs to be checked for causes of orthostatic hypotension like Chat Doctor. Other causes of syncope like micturition /sneezing /neurogenic/vasovagal or carotid sinus syncope needs to be looked for. It would help to get a thorough neurological, cardiac and medical check up done to establish Theo cause of such symptoms.",

If there is no response, then one can think of pacemaker. During giddiness or impending syncope, following maneuvers should be tried, Leg-crossing with simultaneous tensing of leg, abdominal, and buttock muscles, Hand grip, which consists of maximum grip on a rubber ball or similar object, Arm tensing, which involves gripping one hand with the other while simultaneously abducting both arms. Plenty of oral fluids and increase in salt intake may also help. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

It was around 3 in the afternoon, I was not dehydrated and had already eaten lunch.  I have a long list of allergies; the most dangerous are shellfish and  penicillin.  Every time I come back to consciousness I have large red blotches and hive on my arms and upper thighs.  Previous Doctors have thought my fainting spells were caused my anaphylactic allergic reactions but recently another doctor claimed I have vasodepressor syncope and the hives are caused from over-heating (which I often get hives from).  I was wondering If you also thought I should see a cardiologist or should continue on new allergy medications.Howell come to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, apart from the allergic condition if this is pure syncope then this could be due to cardio vascular disease or central nervous system related disease and these both possibilities need to be ruled out, if this turned unremarkable then one can think about the allergy, but syncope is very uncommon in your case, with eruption of haves hysteric attack may be likely, hope this information helps."

        "my friend was told that he has an irregular heart rate 39-40bpm.and that he is lucky that he wake up in the morning.and that he needs a pacemaker to be put in.and for him to go to emergency room.but my friend didnt.what is going to happen to this person if he doesnt soon get the pacemaker in?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of heart block is more in your friends case. It is conduction defect in heart when impulses are regularly conducted. So heart is not beating properly and hence blood circulation in the body is also not proper. pacemaker insertion is must for him. If he is not willing for pacemaker, he may develop brain damage (paralysis) due to decreased blood supply to brain. Sudden stoppage of heart is also seen due to heart block. So sudden cardiac arrest may occur, and it is life-threatening. So convince him for pacemaker insertion. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

If the lesion is confirmed (Block) then no need to go for second opinion, now you need to think about the next procedure, three option are there first and best change the lifestyle, minimize the risk factor like stress, obesity, smoking, avoid high calorie diet, regular follow up, controlling high blood pressure, and other medication for all of these you have to see the cardiac disease counselor and dietitian, second is stent placement, and third is CABG, over clinical condition matters the great. Hope I have answered your query, let me know for further assistance,",
        "my mother is having pain in chest from almost past one week now, we consulted cardiologist & after ECHO test he suggested that one of the artery has only 19% blood supply to heart, she is diabetic also. is angioplasty required now. Please note that her blood cholesterol is absolutely normal from almost past one year.HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your description. A 2D echo cannot show blockages in the heart arteries. It can show if some walls of the heart chambers are weak following a heart attack. Depending on which wall is affected, the artery which is blocked can be estimated. But the severity of blockage cannot be estimated by a 2 D echo. A 2d echo can give you the pumping function of the heart, which normally is 55-60%. Only an angiography can quantify the blockage severity. So if she has undergone an angiography then it may mean there is 81% of block and 19% of artery is functioning. If she has not undergone angiography then this 19% can be the pumping function of the heart (by 2d echo) which is low. So if angiography is not done then you must go ahead with an angiography to evaluate severity of blockages in the heart. Further, decision regarding angioplasty can be done on basis of results of angiography. If angiography is done already and the blockage is greater than 70% severity., then angioplasty must be done. Wishing her good health. Regards",
        "My wife (31) suffers from complete heart block (AV block). Some doctors say it is congenital. She, however, feels that she was absolutely fine before she, in her 14th year had a severe drug reaction (caused by Quinine and Paraxin ?) that caused these symptoms like bradicardia (hers is 45 bpm). Doctors say if she gets a syncope she should get a dual chambered pacemaker. Can alternate medicine help?**1. Patients with third-degree AV block [complete heart block] typically experience. . Bradycardia (low heart rate: 45 in your wife case), Hypotension [low blood pressure], and. Hemodynamic instability: as the heart cannot react quickly enough to sudden changes in demand or sustain the higher heart rates required for prolonged activity.PS. Prognosis is generally poor without therapy [dual chambered pacemaker is the best alternate] along with medicines to control blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, as well as lifestyle and dietary changes to reduce risk factors associated with heart attack and stroke."

        "I had opent heart surgery in Dec 2013. I still get very fatigued at times...experience shortness of breath...and experience pain in my chest and back. I also tend to cough up a lot of pflegm...Is this normal after open heart surgery? I just don t know what s normal and what s not and when I should be concerned and seek medical attention....Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern. Its extremely important that you get evaluated for the productive cough or phlegm which is evident in the postoperative period of open-heart surgery. This can be a harbinger of chest infection. This should be detected and treated rapidly. For this I advise you to get a baseline 2dimensional echocardiogram and a high resolution digital x-ray chest. In many cases empirical antibiotics will help. This consists of twice a day cefuroxime protein for 5-7 days. This will cure infection in 99.9% individuals. Fatigue after major surgery is very common, due to the metabolic impact created by the surgical stress. This can be improved with good nutritional intake. In all cases avoid smoking and alcohol. One pomegranate a day for 3-4 months from here on will help to build the stamina and combat infections. Its extremely important that you report to your surgeon at the earliest to deal with your health issue along with health reports like baseline EKG and complete blood picture. Consultation with an expert cardiothoracic surgeon will help to formulate expert management. Post your further queries if any. Thank you.",

        "Hi, Im 15 years old and for a while now Ive been having these cyst-like bumps on my inner upper thigh and butt. Sometimes theyre very hard to squeeze, but when something comes out of it, its usually like a yellow, white -mostly white pus that comes out it. And I get pimples on my butt. Recently Ive had a cyst like bump one on my butt and it was very hard and dark, though when I was able to squeeze it, a white cheese like substance came out. As well I have boils, but I dont sit on public toilets seats or anything. As well i have a lot of black heads on my inner upper thighs, and I can feel big nots-bumps under the skin that most of the time surfaces and I can see the cyst like bump, but then it may go back under after a few days or it may just go away. Also I have these dark dots on my inner upper thigh that are dark, hard dots. Oh and one more thing; these cyst like bumps on my inner upper thigh and butt sometimes hurts. Like I cant sit  down properly cause it hurts - but its not all the time. And sometimes they have like raw skin and it burns and hurts to touch them- especially on my upper inner thigh. And sometimes blood will come out of them when I squeeze them. I am not sexually active. I try to be as clean as possible. I just want to know what this is and whats causing it, and how can it be stopped. Its very aggravating, I cant wear shorts or anything, I only wear jeans. Please and thank you for you help.Namaste Welcome to Chat Doctor Greetings of the day You are probably suffering recurrent folliculitis in the buttock area.  Other possibility I would like to consider if you are very hairy and sit for prolonged time is Colonial Sinus.  Both of them require assessment by General Surgeon.  It will require a course of antibiotics like Augmenting for 7 - 10 days., local ointment, hot sat bath.  If it turns out to be Colonial sinus/ fistula in ANO it will require further surgical intervention.  Any case you need to see a Surgeon. Do get back if you have any doubts. Take care Regards"

        "I have a friend who is experiencing chronic pain lately and does not know the reason. He has pain in both legs and shoulder and arms and takes advil and tylenol to no avail. We are thinking he has arthritis of some kind. Is CBD effective on arthritis and chronic pain?Hello and Welcome to Ask A Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In my opinion the first thing to do is to consult a doctor for a more detailed history of complaints, physical examination, and blood check, to put the right diagnosis, because treating the cause of the symptoms is more important than treating only the pain. Considering the symptoms pain in legs and shoulders, these might be related to many problems' arthritis, neuropathy or muscular disorders. Your friend can use Naproxen, daily for some weeks and Tylenol, and also Prednisone daily. CBD oil is effective on treating severe pain in arthritis, it reduces inflammation and has a few side effects It can be used in form of liquid or capsules, but in my opinion, it's better to find the cause of this pain first. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

        "What is best way to lower level of inflammation in one s body (elder), to combat knee osteoarthritis, and prevent subsequent damage to other organs and systems, ie. heart and brain especially. I always prefer natural solutions. Thanks so much for considering my question.Hi there. Combating inflammation knee osteoarthritis in elderly can be tough, but not impossible. First you have to understand that osteoarthritis mainly arises due to normal degenerative processes that occur with ones aging. So the best way to reduce inflammation and pain is to reduce the factors that cause them. The most important aspect of the treatment that I prescribe to my patients is physiotherapy. Not only does it strengthen the qua Chat Doctor.  Secondly if the muscles are strengthened the surface of the bones that rub against each other and cause pain in osteoarthritis are less prone to do so and the further rate of degeneration comes down. Analgesics can help control acute flares. But like you, I prefer less of allopathic treatment for osteoarthritis and more of exercises. With their muscles becoming stronger they become more confident of ambulating around the house as well. I am not very certain of the extent natural remedies and alternative medicines can help.  And rest assured that inflammation arising in osteoarthritis is least likely to affect the heart and brain. There is no correlation. Some lifestyle changes like avoiding too much of climbing stairs or squatting can be avoided.",

The description of the lumps you have given does fit in the description of the actinic keratitis, so the possibility cannot be denied. However, confirmation of the diagnosis is essential as actinic keratitis is closely related with development of skin cancer. I would advise you to visit a dermatologist or oral & maxillofacial surgeon or plastic surgeon for physical examination of the lumps. Physical examination plays a major role in the diagnosis of this disorder. In addition, you might need to go for a biopsy as cell type can be confirmed only under microscope. Based on the test results, diagnosis can be made and treatment can be decided. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Take care. Best,",

She has just gotten off a strong medicine 9days ago for this which was strong also. Seems to keep reoccuringHello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious disease specialist, answering your concern. If I am not wrong you are talking about c def and not d CEF. C. difficile is the bacteria causing infection in the gut of the patient who is taking a antibiotic for long period. C. def causes diarrhea in delimited patient like your mom. Many a times bacteria present as communal flora and not cause any symptoms but if the symptoms occurs than treatment is necessary. In the first step it is necessary to stop injudicious use of broad spectrum antibiotics. You can take lactic acid bacilli spore under your doctors' guidance. It helps the growth of the communal bacteria which further stops the growth of C.difficile infection. In severe cases you can take the Combination of Vancomycin and Metronidazole under your doctors' guidance. I will be happy to answer your further concern you can contact me here, or you can contact me on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.  Thank you, ChatDoctor",

I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Yes, it can go away. C.difficile is infection caused by the clostridium bacteria present in the system. It occurs because of to prolong antibiotic therapy. Azithromycin antibiotics should be taken under your doctors' guidance to clear the infection. All other symptoms like fatigue, headache etc. are because of the diarrhea caused by this infection. Please maintain good hygiene as it is helpful to cure infection. Good handwashing is also a good tool to combat the infection.

        "My 85 year old mother suffered from colotis from September of 10 until she fell and broke her hip in January.  She came through the hip surgery well.  She was put into a rehab hospital where she contracted c diff and eventually passed away on Feb 18th of this year.  While visiting her, I never saw anyone giving her the option of washing her hands before meals.  I didnt know what c diff was until she passed.  Whats up with this c diff?Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Clostridium difficile is a potentially dangerous organism which might affect the intestinal mucosa giving rise to diarrhea ending in septicemia if not taken care of. All the risk factors were there with your mother (old age with lowered immunity, immobility, and possible usage of broad spectrum antibiotics post surgery for the hip resulting in the death of other normally occurring bacteria in the intestines which prevent the growth of cl diff) and so the growth of the clostridium difficile was without any resistance, and it could not be controlled WTH the medications. I hope I have answered your query. In case of any doubt, please do not hesitate to ask. Thanks for using the Chat Doctor forum for the query on health. Good luck."

I have a baker s cyst behind each knee, continual pins and needles, and aching legs from my rear-end down to my foot. I m trying to figure out what might be wrong. Osteoarthritis perhaps? Thanks, HeatherHello, As bakers cyst are formed in the popliteal fossa which contains the blood vessels and nerves passing from there this cyst may lead to malfunction in the vascular and nerve function.  We need to take up an MRI of the knee and see if the cyst is compromising the normal functions of the veins and blood vessels. If so an orthopedist opinion might be needed.  Physiotherapy plays a key role in the rehabilitation of the bakers' cyst. And sometimes with exercise, the cyst gets vanished on its own. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most bakers cyst patients have actually vanished the cyst from the region just with exercise. Hope I have answered your query.

There are genes which are markers for certain cancers but every one having the marker might not get the disease. Immunoglobulins are certain proteins that are part of the immune mechanism. Medical literature says that there is a traditional view that immunoglobulins produced only by differentiated B lymphocytes has been challenged as immunoglobulin genes have been found to be expressed in hematopoietic human cancer cells.

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can answer the question about the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.\n\nThe key differences in causes, symptoms, and management strategies between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes can be seen in the following examples:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**:\n   - The preferred treatment is injectable insulin, with the dose adjusted according to blood glucose levels.\n   - Constant monitoring of blood glucose is important to avoid hypoglycemia and coma.\n   - Oral hypoglycemic agents are not effective in Type 1 Diabetes.\n   - Example: A 45-year-old woman with Type 1 Diabetes for 28 years is struggling to control her blood sugar levels, and her doctor advises her to monitor her blood glucose at home with a glucometer and adjust insulin doses accordingly.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**:\n   - The preferred treatment is usually oral medication, but insulin may be required in some cases.\n   - Diet changes and exercise can help control Type 2 Diabetes.\n   - Example: An 80-year-old man with Type 2 Diabetes is taking glymepride, metformin, and teneligliptin, and his doctor advises him to change his diet and exercise to control his blood sugar levels.\n\nIn terms of symptoms, Type 1 Diabetes often presents with severe symptoms such as weight loss, polyuria, and polydipsia, whereas Type 2 Diabetes may be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms.\n\nIn terms of long-term health outcomes, individuals with Type 1 Diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy and careful blood glucose monitoring to prevent complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes can often control their condition with lifestyle changes and oral medication, but may eventually require insulin therapy and are also at risk for complications such as cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.",

Please advice me. Thanks & Warm RegardsJay PrakashBangaloreHi, Mr. Jay Prakash, As you have mentioned you have chronic calcific pancreatitis which was diagnosed in 2001. And you have mentioned that you have Type 2 Diabetes which is not under control despite regular medicine. In your case I want know on what basis you have been labeled as Type 2 Diabetes. We need to differentiate between Type 2 Diabetes from pancreatic Diabetes (which is more likely in your case). Treatment of two is different, Type 2 Diabetes usually be controlled with oral medication. In pancreatic Diabetes insulin is only treatment for controlling blood sugar level. In your case I want to know 1) Your age. 2) How many years back you have been diagnosed as having Diabetes. 3) Family history of diabetes. 4) Your height and weight, (usually type 2 diabetic patients are obese, Pancreatic diabetic patient usually lean, thin, weight below average) 5) Signs of malnutrition, low hemoglobin, significant weight loss. 6) Current medicines for diabetes. I will advise you to do following test1) Stool Examination for fat, elastane. 2) Complete blood count, 3) Serum level of vitamin D (fat soluble vitamin), calcium. On the basis of your history, clinic Examination, investigation we can confirm your type of Diabetes, and accordingly need to modify your treatment. Till that time you can start insulin according to your treating Consultant. I think this much information is enough for you, you are free to write your queries to me.  Chat Doctor. ",
        "My daughter is 45 and has had Type 1 Diabetes for 28 years and she is really struggling and the only place that will see her is a clinic and they have no clue how to help her with her blood sugar. She has been in 2 comas in the last 4 days. We live in Pooler Georgia ( outside Savannah) and desperately need help finding an endocrinologist.Thanks for asking on Chat Doctor. The preferred treatment of type 1 diabetes is injectable insulin, the dose of which is according to the levels of blood glucose. However, constant monitoring of blood glucose is important because a too high dose of insulin can lead to hypoglycemia and coma and a too low dose can lead to high blood sugar levels. So dose has to be carefully adjusted as per the blood glucose levels. In type 1 diabetes the pancreatic beta cells are unable to produce enough insulin to take care of the needs of the body. Oral hypoglycemic agents are not effective I type 1 diabetes because there is not enough beta cell function since Has act by increasing insulin action. You will need to monitor blood glucose at home with a glucometer and adjust insulin doses accordingly. Hope it helps.",

        "Yes I just found out my mom is diabetic we eat the same foods because we live together I go to the doctor January 13th Im a little afraid to find out if Im diabetic what glucose level is too high that can make me diabetic so I can change my eating habits Im so nervous?Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor !  I understand your concern. Diabetes may develop due to various factors. The general mechanism is that isle cells of pancreas are not producing insulin which helps in keeping your glucose levels in check or insulin produced isn't acting on the glucose to keep levels controlled. I would suspect diabetes if the random blood glucose levels are anywhere about more than 180 mg/DL and would advise a fasting sugar test and glucose tolerance to conclude for diabetes. Eating healthy and keeping physically active helps delay the onset or keeps it at bay. Hope this clarifies your concern. Thank you for the query. Take care "

Thanks, bnbmHI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Sinus and nasal congestion can be related to different causes, but the most common are infection (usually viral or bacterial) or allergies. If you have no history of allergies, then your symptoms are likely due a viral infection. There are medications that may help you such as oral or topical decongestants.

First thing you should do is steam inhalation thrice a day that will ease your congestion and if sputum or phlegm is yellow or foul smelling than you have to take an antibiotic course like lifetime for a week, for which you have to consult a pulmonologist .you can continue with the inhalerspulmonologist can guide u regarding the inhaler therapy as if u were an ex smoker then he can do a spirometry and according to the stage of the disease he can start you on long acting beta 2 agonists and inhaled steroids or some anticholinergic inhalers like geotropism, these inhalers will cause some bronchodilator and that will ease the sputum clearance and intern will decrease your congestion thanks/regards feel free to ask more questions may god bless you with good health"

Took pure cranberry juice all last week 2x a day. Seemed to get better. Stoped yesterday. Infection back today. Can I shrink the prostate with diet????Hi, Thanks for writing in. An enlarged prostate is a common condition after the age of 60 years in males. To confirm if you really have an enlarged prostate, you should get an ultrasound scan done and this must also include urinary bladder volumes before and after urination. An enlarged prostate causes retention of urine in many people and that is responsible for increased frequency of urination and urgency. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate includes, urinary urge, increased frequency of urination even in the night, pain during urination and sometimes blood in urine. Significant retention of urine can cause urinary tract infection also. It will help if you also get PSA (prostate specific antigen) levels tested at least once every year. This will show any risk of developing prostate cancer. Mild prostate enlargement is treated with medications like fin astride and tamsulosin. Severe prostate hypertrophy requires surgical treatment.",

The underlying pathological mechanism involves a loss of image stabilization by loss of reflex control of eye muscle control when a person has their gaze fixated.  Things such as toxicity, infection (most importantly meningitis) or side effects from antibiotics can cause the condition.

        "Our nearly 6 month old, completely healthy and happy granddaughter sways her head constantly when on her tummy or is being held. It is not because she is sleepy. At first we thought it was because her head / neck muscles were not strong enough, or because she was swaying to the music. She is sitting up fine,alone, though she still has to concentrate on sitting up. Her head is still when she sits up, perhaps because she is concentrating on her balance. One family thought is that perhaps her eyes don t move, so she moves her head to see! The baby s mother will ask at the 6 month check up in a week +, but we are interested in what you have to say.Hi, Is this associated with head tilting to one side, or any abnormal jerkiness (nystagmus) of eyeballs? When these three features occur together (head shaking, head tilt, nystagmus), it indicates a condition called spasms nu tuns, a benign condition that usually resolves in few months. All features may not be there initially, and may come in succession. In such cases I used to take MRI brain to rule out any abnormality and reassure the parents. Your doctor will discuss with you on coming visit. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",
        "i have a healthy 32 month old son who on 3 occations today, has closed his eyes ( kinda fluttery) and just blanked out (maybe 10 seconds) when i asked what is he doing, he was a bit slobbery & slurry with his words...a second later, he was back to his rambuncous self...what should i do?Hello, The symptoms you mentioned here are very suggestive of absence seizures. They start abruptly in child Chat Doctor.  In this, there is a brief abrupt lapse of awareness or consciousness, sudden discontinuation of the activity being preformed followed by fluttering eyes or staring spells which doesn't last for more than 20 to 30 seconds. And there may be many episodes like this in a day.It's better to go for a neurological examination and checkup, so the cause of this can be identified and treated accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Can you please explain this to me, and is it or can it be life threatening? I have Fibromyalgia, could this be associated with her getting this problem. Your Sincerely Michelle MokeHi, A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. The cyst can range from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball. This is not a serious complaint. Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth, soft lump under the skin. They are made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid, called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement. There is no need to seek medical attention unless she experiences pain, swelling or stiffness of the area. They can be removed surgically if needed.  Chat Doctor. ",

What sould I do?Hello! Thank you for the query. Ganglion appears near a joint indeed as ganglion is connected with a joint and filled with joint fluid. He may have some benign skin lesion like a lipoma or sebaceous cyst. It is hard to tell from this point. However, there is a simple way to diagnose it. He should have an ultrasound of this lump which should answer what he is dealing with. Hope this will help. Regards.",

The complaints you give point towards gastroesophageal reflux disease (HERD) or \"heartburn\".HERD is usually caused by, impaired expulsion of gastric reflux from the esophagus.it may be triggered by consuming food in large quantities, or specific foods containing certain spices, high fat content, or high acid content and lifestyle choicest treatment of heartburn depends on the underlying cause. Medicines such as H₂ receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are effective for gastritis and HERD, the two most common causes of heartburn.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry about. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. There are some reasons that might be responsible for heartburn. First, you should know that typical heart pains have some characteristics. They usually are retro-sternal pains likes quizzing, tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, neck and jaw. Furthermore, they last from 5 to 20 minutes. Long lasting pains are not typical heart pains, and in your age ischemic heart disease is rare. To exclude ischemic heart disease I would recommend a cardiac echo, a full blood analyze and a street test. Another reason of heartburn high be a gastrointestinal problem. So you should consult a gastrohepatologyst and maybe a fibrogastroscopi.Also, you have to exclude a Selectric problem doing a topical X-ray. After all this we can better judge what we are dealing with and how to treat it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor. ",

I have no clue what this could beHello. Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. I read your query and understand your concern. Now, the description of the heartburn you provided, is with the highest probability from the stomach, as the origin. This symptom is called paresis, and is produced when the highly acid content of the stomach is returned to esophagus or, sometimes, throat and mouth. This can happen from various reasons, mostly from a disbalance between acid-producing and acid-inhibiting factors in the stomach and from the lower esophageal sphincter insufficiency. Without digging further more into theoretical details, I would suggest you to refrain from certain food and beverages that favor acid production and/or inhibit acid-inhibiting factors and/or lower the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter:- alcohol and tobacco-chocolate- tea, coffee (Anthony derivatives)- spicy and grilled food, and pickles would also recommend you to start a course with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI): omeprazole 20 mg x 2 tb/d for the first two weeks, then 20 mg x 1 tb/d for four other weeks, and accompanied by risperidone x 3 tb/d. Also, you should not lie down, but sit up or stand, for at least 90 minutes after you have had your last meal. If the symptom persists after all these measures are undertaken, I would recommend an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, for further investigation. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards.",
        "Hi, last night I started getting a pain in my chest which I thought was an indigestion. I took some gaviscon and it didn t shift it.

I woke up this morning and the pain is still there but not as bad. It feels like I have a stitch all over my stomach and hurts when I walk around. I have taken painkillers and liver salt type things and nothing has worked.Hello, jackiehands90,Your heartburn symptoms suggest that you are sensitive to acid in your stomach. The different types of food and Chat Doctor.  Tomato based products, too much milk (Contains calcium which stimulates acid), caffeine in coffee or tea, alcoholic beverages, all add to the problem. Smoking will make there flux worse because of its effect on the sphincter at the junction esophagus and stomach. If you are not getting relief from taking anti acids such as Davison or Maalox, try taking 15 mg. of Lansoprazole or 20 mg. of Omeprazoleabout an hour before your main meal of the day. If needed you can take it twice a day. If symptoms persist after 4 weeks, I advise you to see digestive disease specialist for further work up. Wish you good health."

        "My 9 year old son has suffered from a number of strep throats over the past year and a half. He has been sick 6 times. Like alot of the families that have been sharing their stories about the symptoms their children were experiencing,My son is exhibiting strange,aggressive, OCD,anxiety, worrying ,separation anxiety, irrational fears and thoughts.afraid to leave the house. My husband died,July,2013 from a very rare autoimmune disease that attacked the liver. Primary Sclerosing Colengitus.my question, is my son merely reacting to the loss of his dad, or could this behavior been brought on by strep and it could be PANDAS syndrome. My son acts out mostly at home. He is a straight A student with good behavior. He does show alot of anxiety at school. If a child is suffering from an undiagnosed case of PANDAS syndrome wouldn t it play out everywhere not at home primarily. Do symptoms come and go. Some more episodes more intense than othersHello, History of sore throat and symptoms as described by you probably suggest the possibility of PANDAS syn Chat Doctor.  However, it needs to be confirmed by laboratory tests for streptococcal sore throat. Treatment consists of course of antibiotics, for behavioral problems cognitive and behavioral therapy, some antidepressant medications, etc. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",
        "My son had the pneumococcal IM (14 Serotype) Serology test. He didn t have the streptococcal pneumonia vaccination as a baby and is now 15. He was positive for ALL serologies. He was treated with Biaxin 500 mg daily for 20 days and two rounds of Suprax 400 mg daily for 20 days (two rounds). All serologies have dropped below positive except for pneumo Ab type 19 (19F) and Pneumo Ab Type 57 (19A). Those two have actually gone up.. Anytime he shows an increase in Igm number he triggers with psychotic symptoms. His immune system is somehow compromised. He has been diagnosed with PANDAS and PANS. His thyroid antibodies were 232 and 110 and have come down to 110 and 51 after the antibiotics. Can you help?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done pneumococcal vaccination. In newer pneumococcal vaccines, they provide benefit against 23 stereotypes. And it is very effective in preventive pneumococcal pneumonia. It should be given every 5 yearly. So your son will be protected for 5 years after vaccination. And it can be given in patients of PANDAS and PAN. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.",

There is no specific treatment For dengue fever. No, any medicine which helped to build Platelet faster. What are the status of dengue NS1 antigen test and Dengue antibodies (IG G IG M)? First not be panic about 65000 of platelet count. Platelet Transfusion is only option to increase Platelet if platelet falls below 20000. If it needs any platelet transfusion please ask to doctor for Single donor platelet apheresis which will helps to increase platelet 30,000 to 70,000 in a single transfusion.  For vomiting and nausea please ask to doctor about Pantoprazole or sanitizing and ondansetron injections I/ V, if physical condition and vitals are stable, according to body weight."

        "I have twins kids; son and daughter. They are 4 years old. They have never complained about any problem with their eye and seeing anything. However since my wife has eye power -7.0 in both the eyes from the age of 9 years, therefore we thought to check up kids eyes with the doctor. The pediatric ophthalmologist from the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India prescribed the cylindrical power for both my son and daughter. Son power is - 1.25 and -1.5. Daughter -1.50 and -1.75. The doctor prescribed the glasses for both of them. I am completely confused and worried. I have following questions to ask and I would highly appreciate any suggestion and advice for my queries: 1. Do we need to use glasses as per the doctor advice? 2. Is it possible that these powers will decrease and completely go away as the kids grow? 3. What are the precautions we should take? Any particular nutrition? 4. Is their any other form of treatment? ThanksHi, I am answering your questions :1. Yes, you need to wear them glasses as per doctor advice, because if they don't wear glasses then there number will increase and secondly, problem of headache can occur. 2. Since, the number is more, chances of them getting completely ok is remote but yes the number can decrease over a period of time if they continuously wear glasses. 3. Precautions like watching less TV, and from a distance of at least 8 feet. You need to give vitamin A rich foods like mango, carrot, cabbage, spinach, sweet potato, tomato, watermelon etc. I hope this has helped you. If you have any more questions, I will be happy to help.

I reviewed your query and here is my answer. It looks like your child has fever due to vaccination in which case there is no need to worry about much as this may happen after vaccination. But it could be due to some sort of infection and CBC is first line and mandatory test for that. It will tell you about anemic status of the child. Besides this, the WBC count will tell you whether there is an ongoing infection or not. If there is increased neutrophil count, then it is most likely bacteria, but if there is increased or decreased lymphocytes, then it is more likely virus because virus can give you both increased or decreased lymphocytes.

This suggests that understanding the correct vaccination schedule is crucial for the vaccine to be effective.\n\nAdditionally, in the case of the rabies vaccine, it is mentioned that if the dog's vaccination schedule is out of time, then the person may need to complete the rabies Vaccine schedule. This highlights the importance of understanding the vaccination schedule for effective disease prevention.\n\nIn the case of the influenza vaccine, it is mentioned that the vaccine should be taken in the autumn before winter sets in for it to be effective.

        "I recently contracted influenza and am still recovering from it. Thank God for Tamiflu . Also had the stomach virus (throw up, head spins). I cannot have a flu shot because of a serious allergy to the preservative used in most shots. Is there a way I can get this without a shot? If so, would it be of help for me to get it now?Hello, The serious allergy to preservative in most shots is not clear, and you may be referring to the egg protein if you have egg allergy. The influenza vaccine should be taken in the autumn before winter sets in for it to be effective. People with egg allergy can have the influenza vaccine provided the lowest cut off limit of egg protein in the vaccine is used. As there are many manufacturers, the egg protein in the vaccines vary and now the companies have to quantify the amount of egg protein for egg allergy patients. A 2-step approach is used (if the egg allergy is severe or anaphylaxis, and you definitely need the flu shots because of asthma, COPD etc.).10% of the vaccine is given s/c, then the patient is observed for 30 minutes, and if fine, the rest of the 90% of the vaccine is administered.

Could u explain this in detail?The transplant rejection is condition in which cells from the transplanted tissue of a donor initiate an immunologic attack on the cells and tissue of the recipient. The donated organ, called an allograft if the donor and recipient are unrelated, is transplanted into the recipient, called the host. Rejection can occur when the host’s immune responses are directed against the graft. The rapidity and reversibility of rejection depend on the various mechanisms involved, such as peritransplant ischemia and mechanical trauma, preformed antibody interactions with graft antigens, alloantigen-reactive T cells, and abnormal tissue remodeling.

His cancer has been extremly aggressive on his back bones and hips. Any advise about his current decision?Discouraging chemotherapy may make him ineligible for transplant because his disease should be in at least very good partial response before transplant.

Treatment of posttransplantation TMA relies on removal of any precipitating factors, relief of symptoms, and PE or plasma infusion. Therapeutic options for posttransplant TMA, including plasma therapy and targeted complement inhibitors can be used to treat those suffering from TMA. With the latest guidelines, there have been patients with TMA who were completely treated at the end of one year with hospitalization and maintenance immune suppression. The response to treatment varies in every patient, and we pray that your friend makes a complete recovery at the earliest.",

        "dear doctor,i have very swollen, red tonsils that are now COVERED in white spots which are now turning yellowish and some grayish-brown. i went to the doctor and they performed the swab and told me it wasnt bacterial so its viral. i know when it comes to viruses your body just needs to stay hydrated and fight it off. my issue is that in the last 5 months ive had painful tonsilitis at least 6 times. I feel my tonsils are doing more harm than good for me, should i get them removed? also what are the best home remedies for this?Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. As a home remedy for tonsillitis, you should do gargles with warm salt water or with chlorhexidine & water in 1:3 dilution. They will not treat the viral infection but prevent super-added bacterial infection. You can also take lozenges available OTC. Also take plenty of water and warm liquids.  Take paracetamol with ibuprofen for pain relief, fever and inflammation. You can get your tonsils removed if you have recurrent tonsillitis. You have said that you had this problem 6 times in 5 months. Guidelines about tonsillectomy says that it can be done if tonsillitis occurs 7 times or more in a year or 5 times or more per year for 2 years consecutively or 3 times or more per year for 3 years consecutively. So, see whether you fall in these criteria or not. Tonsillectomy can also be done if tonsillitis is severe and affecting day-to-day life. Consult a good ENT surgeon for the same and decide further. Hope this will be helpful. Do ask if any more question. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Take care.",

I read your query and I understand your concern. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost anyone. Actually, most people don't know they have CMV because it rarely causes symptoms. However, if you are planing to get pregnant or have a weakened immune system, CMV is cause for concern. Once infected with CMV, your body retains the virus for life. You do not mention any symptom, except the test report results. However, need treatment when they're having symptoms of CMV infection, such as pneumonia. The kind of treatment depends on the symptoms and their severity. If treatment is needed, its most often in the form of antiviral Chat Doctor.  Antiviral ",

Cytomegalovirus is notorious for causing a malformation in the first three months of life. If the mother infected with the cytomegalovirus in the first trimester of the pregnancy than this virus interferes with the organ development of the baby. All the mentioned problems in your case is related to this defect. I think you can understand that once the organ is defected it can't be cured with any medications. But you can visit the pediatric surgeon in your area, they can give you opinion. Some malformations can be corrected with the surgery. So you can correct some problems of your child which is possible. Some problems can be corrected with the aid e.g. hearing aid. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.

I just read about it and would like to know what you think?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, CMV (Cato megalo virus) can cause sore throat, enlarged glands in neck, cold etc. But it is not commonly infecting virus. CMV infection is common with immunosuppressive conditions like HIV infection, patient taking steroids or chemotherapeutic Chat Doctor. .

Where can I find specialists in this? No one seems to know!,!HiT hanks for posting on ChatDoctorCMV is a common virus that can infect anybody. Most people with CMV will never know and may manifest no symptoms if they are healthy. Once infected, your body retains the virus for life, but it may never disturb you. However, whether symptomatic or not, it is a cause for concern in pregnancy. It spreads from person to person through body fluids. There is no cure for CMV but Chat Doctor. The symptoms you present may signal an active CMV and when any of those symptoms appears, it's always good to see the Doctor for evaluation and management. I will advise you take an HIV test to confirm your negative status as it could be one of the things that can weaken your system and make you prone to developing an active CMV infection. Other thing can weaken your system and increase your risk of CMV symptoms are bone marrow or organ transplant, malnutrition, long use of steroids, chemotherapy/cancer. As for the idea of being misdiagnosed, I will suggest you take the CMV test again in a different laboratory. Management of people with very weak immune system like newborns and people with active infection is usually with antiviral "

You describe a complicated medical history and must discuss these details with your dentist or oral surgeon before any extraction is planned. You are explaining systemic effects of an infection. I cannot rule out your other medical conditions as contributing factors. Continue to take anti-inflammatory medications. You may need an additional prescription of an antibiotic to control the spread of infection. Please do not continue to delay treatment. Rinse and avoid chewing in that location as well.

N/T in bilateral feet that migrated quickly up to knees and then tohips and then to elbows and wrists. Then intense burning ache in the joints that followed the same progression. MRI show lesions in the brain, none in spinal cord or brain stem. Lumbar puncture showed only elevated proteins (67). they checked for lymes, encephalitis, meningitis.ets... The first time in Novenmber he last all pheripheral reflexes. This time they sre dull only at this point. I am concerned that they are missing something. My husband states the pain is 9/10, and the only meds that help are Neurontin and toradol. Narcotocs and muscle relaxers do not help at all. We questioned CIDP, MS, transverse myelitis, and they have no answers. They havedone another MRI of brain and brain stem/ neck area.

But the fact is that the neurology is still beyond the scope of advanced medical science, the way in which it presents are taking many more coming decades to be fully evaluated. Rather than exposing him to repeated MRI radiation, I suggest to focus more on physiotherapy and supportive care. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

First, these three may be related to each other or not. A cerebral MRI would help a lot of understanding better the nature of the cerebral lesion and its natural history.

Is there still a possibility that these lesions could be malignant?HIT hank for asking to Chat Doctor I think the important is clinical sing and symptoms you have not said anything about your clinical problems most of the words you used here are being used by radiologist which most of the time does not create an exact sense and so the radiologist most of the time advise it for correlation with clinical condition, to rule out the possibility of malignancy, there has to be several tests to be taken in hand for final diagnosis of malignancy, one can not say anything about it like that only, if you are suspicious for malignancy then MRI is the initial test to be done first then numbers of other test are there but that can only be considered when MRI is indicative of some malignancy have nice day.",
        "In the last two weeks I ve had a CT scan, Brain MRI, 3 treatments of Solu Medrol. On Wed of this week I had a spinal tap, so of course I m sore and tired and today (Friday) I went in for Spinal MRI. They tried it twice and each time it started I got very cold and clamy. I felt like I was going to vomit. They discontinued the MRI since my body couldn t take anymore. I wasn t stressed about the MRI today, so I don t think it was due to anxiety. I had MRI last week of my brain and I was completely fine. After today s attempt at getting the spine MRI, I went to my car to leave and I ended up vomiting. I ve felt nauseated all day and now I m burning up with fever. Should I be worried? If I m still feverish tomorrow, should I see a Dr.? Thank you for your adviceI read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. It is puzzling though, I have never encountered any report of such effects of MRI and furthermore there is no reason for the MRI to cause any of those symptoms, it's a harmless exam, doesn't carry any sort of radiation. So I think it must be a coincidence you must have some infection causing the fever, nausea and vomiting which is manifesting its symptoms. I hope to have been of help."

Onset of puberty is overtly visible in females, in contrast the early signs of puberty in males are not visible [which might be your concern].2. You should visit a GP or Neuroendocrinologist regarding his puberty issues who will order a blood test to find out whether there are any problems with the children hormones [testosterone] or may also order an MRI or an ultrasound to check the glands to find out whether they are working properly.3. Well-balanced diet [proper nutrition], adequate sleep, regular physical activity is generally the best management guidelines.PS. If you are concerned about lagging behind his peers, just check for any hormonal disturbances like: narrow shoulders, disinterests in girls, shyness, being fat, non-visible Adams Apple",
        "My son age 15, Acts very inmuture ,has gained alot of weight, eats alot, does not have any signs of going into puberty, no hair, voice change,or any of the normal signs should we have him checked or is this just delayed puberty? Very short for his age 4ft 11 138# he is very active . I guess the rapid weight gain has me most concerned, pluss he still acts like a 10 yr old. He is in 9th grade and has withdrawn from alot of the kids he has grown up with because the are so much ahead of him and he feels he is being left behind. Any suggestions? should we check any medical problems?Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Pubertal changes occur in boys and girls around the age of 13 and sometimes 12. The reason the change is the presence of hormones such as progesterone and testosterone. In some cases the weakness of the hormone delays the puberty. Sometimes it is also possible some hormones inhibits the activities of the above hormones. Rapid weight gain could be suggestive to inhibition and thyroid problems. Hyperactivity also points towards this direction. Please consult a competent physician to ascertain the cause and to have proper diagnosis. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.",

When I was young I had surgery for my penis because of my circumcision (the doctor did it wrong when I was a baby) and there is a scar. Is there something wrong? Im scared to be in a relationship and show my penis. help!You should not worry as in most of such cases puberty is delayed because of constitutional causes. In such cases puberty may come between the age of 16 to 20 yrs. I will also suggest you to consult an endocrinologist after a year or so if till then also you do not get puberty. He will get you tested your sex chromatin, sex hormone levels and some other tests to evaluate the causes of delayed puberty."

You are thinking about those occasions on which you get angry, or you are short-tempered. There are so many occasions in your life itself when you behave maturely and with patience when troubled. If you just sit and search your past, you can find so many such occasions. To trigger your positive journey, traveling in a crowded bus, getting pushed, pulled, punched, gnawed, braked etc. You cannot avoid such a journey because there are no other means of transportation available. This is just an example. Now you can think of such experiences you had. That means your short temper is only towards those people whom you are sure, will not react. Why so? That is the answer to your question too. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck."

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, here are some potential causes and implications of experiencing both a discharge from the nipple and the presence of a lump or bulge:\n\n1. Ductal Eurasia (blockage of the ducts): This is mentioned in the context of a 31-year-old man with brown watery discharge from the nipple when expressed, and a constantly painful lump that has grown quickly in his left breast. The discharge is due to the bacterial infection coinciding with the blockage.\n\n2. Post lactational ductal Eurasia: This is also mentioned in the context of the 31-year-old man, and is seen when there is a sudden stoppage of breastfeeding.\n\n3. Local causes like infection, injury, or cancer: This is mentioned in the context of a friend's swollen and enlarged nipple, especially when only one nipple is affected.\n\n4. Hormonal stimulation: This is mentioned in the context of a 22-year-old man with unilateral nipple discharge, where the hormonal stimulation can result in gland growth (Gynecomastia), tenderness, and produce milk and or nipple discharge.\n\n5. Breast infections: This is mentioned in the context of a man bleeding from both breasts, where breast infections are most common in women who are breastfeeding, but men can develop them too.\n\nIn terms of evaluation or addressing these symptoms, the context suggests that:\n\n* A physical examination by a doctor is necessary to determine the cause of the symptoms.\n* Further investigation or treatment should be done according to the report of the discharged fluid.\n* A biopsy of the nipple tissue may be necessary to determine if cancer is present.\n* An ultrasound breast examination may be necessary to evaluate the nature of the lump, its source, and extensions.\n* Treatment may include a simple antibiotic course, incision, or other interventions depending on the findings.",

Now, he noticed some clear discharge from the nipple, especially at nights. What can it be? It is a cancer or not?Hi, thank you for using Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern about your friends' health. If both nipple are affected then general cause like increased prolactin level, while if only one nipple is affected then local causes like infection, injury, cancer can be the cause.  Discharge from male breast is not a normal condition, with swollen and enlarged nipple suggest some sort of infection but as you reported antibiotics did not help, one should get tested the discharge fluid, and should progress further investigation or treatment according to the report of discharged fluid. While you feared worst about cancer, it can not be said certainly without getting biopsy of nipple tissue. Hope this will help you. Regards.",

Men who are going through puberty may experience nipple discharge because of the changing hormone levels in their bodies. Squeezing and manipulating the nipples can cause discharge to happen more frequently.  Breast infections are most common in women who are breastfeeding, but men can develop them too. There are some other conditions too. But nothing to worry. Consult a doctor for physical examination. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

        "Hello.  I am a 22 year old male.  About 9 months ago, maybe more, I noticed in the shower that my left nipple was sticking out farther than my right.  I promptly squeezed it and it had a discharge much like a pimple before it was empty.  After this, nothing else came out that day, but the nipple has remained larger on the left side, and occasionally (once every few days,) if I squeeze it, it will discharge a tiny bit more.  I cannot identify any lumps of any kind to indicate gynecomastia or breast cancer, and am really stumped/concerned as to what else could possibly be causing unilateral nipple discharge in a 22 year old male.Dear, We understand your concerns went through your details. A woman can normally have some type of nipple discharge throughout her adult life. For men, nipple discharge can indicate a problem. During hormone imbalances such as adolescence, the male gland can be stimulated. This hormonal stimulation can result in gland growth (Gynecomastia), tenderness, and produce milk and or nipple discharge. If squeezed / traumatized enough, a clear fluid can be express from almost anyone. This is normal but hurting tissues this much is not a good idea. With gland stimulation, the discharge can be milk like or thick like a pimple. Nipple discharge is a concern if:bloody or fluid colored red, pink, or brown looks like pus especially accompanied by inflammation and or fever one sided (unilateral)happens without squeezing the gland sticky and clear or a cloudy black or brown. I suggest you not to try diagnosing your problem. Please consult a surgeon. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute detail possible. Hope this answers your query.  Further clarifications are welcome. Good luck. Happy New Year. Take care.",

Can physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer? Can a healthy diet help to prevent breast cancer? Does smoking cause breast cancer? Can drinking alcohol increase the risk of breast cancer?HIT hank for asking to ChatDoctorI appreciate your concern here are the answers of your questions 1) while comparing with the normal breast, the normal breast looks more pendulous than the malignant one, on palpation one can feel the hard lump inside the breast, untreated case more prone to fungal infection, loss of weight.2) If you find the lump look for mobility if this is freely moves then no need to worry, still mammogram, CT scan, biopsy are must.3) Wearing the bra does not cause the cancer. 4) NO if this benign lesion then this can not turn into malignancy. 5) The breast malignancy is not always inherit ant. 5) Being a female you could get the breast cancer this is not true, but of course the incidence increased. 6) If you are physically active then the chances of these reduces greatly. 7) The balance and healthy diet makes the difference. 8) the chances of breast cancer in smokers is higher than the non-smokers, and the same is true for alcohol, hope this information helps you have nice day.",

Please share your experiences about hashimoto patients.1. you may consult a homeopathic specialist on how to use the selected medicines according to your growth and development (physical+mental).2. Because Hashimoto thyroid its is also called as autoimmune thyroiditis, thus Immunomodulator (Malayan) treatment has to be given side by side.3. Because your immune system will be time and again attacking your thyroid gland, dose has to be adjusted in timely manner, so remain in touch with your attending physician,",

I had good results with Thyroxine, Anti inflammatory Chat Doctor. You can use them and observe. If the swelling of the thyroid is too big, then surgery has to be done.

I can understand your concern. Hashimotoss disease affect thyroid glands. It is not for breast. If you have any breast lump then you should go for examination and if needed go for biopsy of that lump. If you have any thyroid problem then go for T3, T4 and TSH level as well as ultrasound thyroid. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.",
        "Hello. I have Hashimoto s. I feel best on 3 grains of NDT. My TSH is .005 at this dose. My endo lowered my dose and now I am tired, and in more pain plus skin conditions that had resolved have returned and my BP is rising. I want to bump the dose back up.Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Hashimotos disease or thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid as a result of an immune attack on the thyroid. Now usually in about 95% of the cases, Hashimoto results in an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism. In a very small percentage of patients that have Hashimoto antibody the thyroid becomes overactive. But this is very rare, and I must say that we rarely see it. I can say that your symptoms (Pain, excessive tiredness, profuse sweating, palpitations,anxiety and irritability) are very indicative for Hyperthyroidism. It would be helpful if you send me a copy of your blood test report, so I can evaluate the results and to know which tests you have already done. A diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism Can be confirmed with blood tests that measure the levels of thyroxine and TSH in your blood. High levels of thyroxine and low or nonexistent amounts of TSH indicate an overactive thyroid. Thank you."

She has been diagnosed with ADHD and have learning disabilities. She is already on behavioral management and IEP in school, but there is no significant benefit.

These medicines will reduce the symptoms of inattention and impulsivity which are main findings in ADHD. Visit a psychiatrist for details of the treatment. Thanks, I hope this helps you. Take care",
        "I have a 14 yr old daughter who has been diagnosed as Borderline Intellectual Functioning by a local Psychologist. She was diagnosed as ADHD at about 7 yrs old. She struggles in school and social environments (common, I know). She is very impulsive and has a tense relationship with her siblings. She is currently being treated by a Psychiatrist and we have previously had her in counseling for her behavior. She has been on numerous medications (stimulants) and is now using a non-stimulant Strattera. We don t really see any change. Methylphenidate seemed to work best for the longest period of time in her life, but through puberty, it seems to have little affect now. We feel as if we are running out of options and we want her to be happy in her life. We re also afraid that her siblings will end up resenting or disliking her, due to her behavior. She has a 16 yr old sister and 3 x 11 yr old siblings (2 brothers and 1 sister--triplets). So there is plenty in our house to lose focus on. I also (Dad) have been diagnosed as ADHD, so I fully understand where that came from. I would like your opinion on other potential treatment options: medication (stimulant, non-stimulant, combination; non-medication, etc.)? Thank you.Hi, thanks for the query. It seems that you are having a lot of trouble with daughter right now. If ADHD remains incompletely treated, it does a toll on children self-esteem also & too many times, in a desire to get noticed, get some appreciation, child engages into undesirable behaviors which are at present your main concern. We need to formulate a multimodal treatment plan for her consisting of medications+ parent teacher management training (PTMT). If methylphenidate has worked for her & if there are no contraindications for methylphenidate, we can shift from atomoxetine (strategy) back to methylphenidate & hike the dose to maximum 60 mg/day. As a part of parent teacher management, we can engage into token economy, contingency management, role plays, time out etc. which are taught by Psychologist to both the parents & teachers in school. Hence, do contact your Psychologist for PTMT; if you need further help do revert to me. Good Luck"

What do you think it is?Hello, Obviously after a visit to the dentist and an allergic reaction a few hours later, you are dealing with allergies due to various allergens (depending on the exact circumstances) such as:1. Latex gloves - usually used for examinations2. Antibiotics - if given before procedure3. Aspirin or NSAID based gargle or mouthwashes4. Chlorhexidine mouthwash5. Local anaestheticsKeeping in mind the above possibilities, your dentist now needs to exclude which ever ones he thinks not possible (as your daughter was not exposed to) and a skin prick test should be the follow-up test after this. Latex allergy can be checked with a blood test for specific IGE and so can chlorhexidine. I hope that was useful. Thanks.",

Anaphylactic shock is caused by the heart being unable to pump enough blood throughout the body due to an allergic reaction, weakening of the heart muscle, or shrinking of the veins (vasodilation).\n2. Injection of epinephrine into the bloodstream will cause an increase of blood flow throughout the body.\n\nPotential triggers include:\n\n1. Allergic reactions to substances such as poison sumac, pine nuts, or protein powder.\n2. Sudden onset itchy rashes and breathing difficulty together can be symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n\nManagement of anaphylactic shock may involve:\n\n1. Avoiding the triggering factor (e.g., avoiding pine nuts if allergic).\n2. Keeping an epinephrine pen for unanticipated anaphylactic reactions.\n3. Consulting an Allergist for prescription and education on self-use of epinephrine pens.\n4.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for your sister as follows:1. First, I assume that she really has anaphylaxis. Unfortunately there are no tests available that can reliably diagnose anaphylaxis. So it's only listening to her symptoms the diagnosis is usually made. But there are other conditions also that might mimic anaphylaxis. However, sudden onset itchy rashes and breathing difficulty together can be symptoms of diagnosis.2.

        "Yesterday I had an anaphylactic reaction to pine nuts. I realized as a young adult that I was allergic to them. Yesterday was by far, the worse reaction ever. Swollen face, tongue, and a restricted airway, as well as severe itching all over. It was also the first time I had to have a shot of epinephrine. I also had 2 steroid shots, as well as dyphenhydramine. I was told to continue Benadryl for 3 days. My question...what should I expect over the next few days? Of course, I m tired, but have a terrible headache today. My face is also flushed and hot. Thanks so my much!Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. The best management of known allergies causing anaphylactic reactions is avoidance of the food you are allergic to. Unfortunately there is no 100% \"curative\" treatment for such food allergies.Hence, my humble suggestion to you would be avoidance of pine nuts in all forms. Please also avoid those food items which contain pine nuts as ingredients.2. As you have a serious anaphylactic reaction requiring epinephrine, future management plan would be to keep an epinephrine pen along with you for unanticipated anaphylactic reactions. It can be life-saving in such accidental unanticipated reaction. Please consult an Allergist who will prescribe you such a pen for self-use and also teach you how to use it and when to use it. Hope above suggestions and information will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards.",

I noticed it an took benedryl (since I do have other food allergies, I new the symptoms). I then slept for the entire next day...as in 24 hours.  Every time I have an allergy flair up, I am usually exhausted.  Is that normal for someone to experience?Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The allergic reaction means when you are exposed to the triggering factor like dust, mite, pollen and food to which your allergic, there will be release of mediators of allergy like histamines which will produce all the symptoms of allergic reaction. As you are known case of allergy these are the routine phenomenon to occur in your body, when these symptoms occur it will make you exhausted and tired. If you test your blood for absolute eosinophil count during the allergic reaction there will be increase in the count. The medicine like been Chat Doctor. So I would suggest you to undergo skin prick test for the most prevalent allergens and identify the allergen causing all these symptoms, and then you can avoid the allergen, or you can take immunotherapy.

Febrex plus was given for only 3-4 days. Now she is fully cured. I have been seeing some vaginal discharge which is transparent and odourless from past 3 days. Once is was a bit light brown in colour. Is it because she was on anitbiotics febrex plus for a long time. iHi there! Thank you for contacting us. Yes, I do believe this is due to the antibiotics. It changes the normal flora (the normal bacteria, the good bacteria) in our bodies. She probably has a yeast infection and would need to be on a prescription to treat it. Sometimes we exchange one more extreme problem for a less problem. This is no long term problems with yeast infections, they are just uncomfortable and annoying. This probably won't be the only time she has one. Get her to the pediatrician, and they can get you a script. Thank you for contacting us.",

This morning she woke up with a lot of pain in her throat and said its slimy, and while she was in the shower she got dizzy and felt weak. I was wondering if the two ate related ad whats happening with her throatHi, Welcome to Chat Doctor! To treat yeast infection, she must take an antifungal tablet such as fluconazole and apply local antifungal cream. No, the two are unlikely to be related. She might be suffering from a viral or bacterial throat infection (Upper respiratory tract infection). She may be given antibiotics (if bacterial infection) to treat her throat infection, along with a paracetamol and cetirizine for symptomatic relief. Warm saline gargles will also bring her relief.

I would recommend you to get vitamin B 12 levels done. There are chances of Reynolds phenomenon. In this condition, people will experience numbness in feet with similar cold feeling. Cold stimulation test confirms it. We should also rule out hypothyroidism where few patient experience similar symptoms. Get T3, T4, and TSH done.

He is on various meds for blood pressure, cholesterol, acid reflux. Always has sweaty palms.Hello, Extreme coldness in the shin & feet are commonly due to peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, etc. It is due to decrease in the blood circulation in the arteries or narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits that decrease the blood flow. You are suggested to get him clinically examined by a GP. Get all the blood workouts, Urinalysis, CT, MRI, Nerve conduction tests, etc. done at the earliest. He should also get cholesterol tests, chest x-ray, Duplex scanning, an echocardiogram, an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), an exercise stress test done to detect arteriosclerosis.  If diabetic, get blood glucose level controlled at every cost. Neglect may trigger the symptoms. His vitals should be normal.

Could you please suggest further moreHi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. In APS, increased risk of DVT is present. Regular intake of anti-coagulants and maintaining an INR between 1.5-2 is necessary.2. Additionally, in long journeys or during major surgeries, movement should be done at the earliest to avoid risk of deep vein thrombosis.3. Any breathing difficulty should be evaluated immediately to rule out pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.4. Infertility is usually present in anti-phospholipid syn Chat Doctor.

ChatDoctor and very pleased to be assisting you with your health questions today. Lupus can affect any part of body, but classic presentation is triad of fever, joint pain, and rash in a woman of childbearing age.  Patients may present with any of the following manifestations-- fatigue, weight changes, skin rashes, oral ulcer, hair fall, shortness of breath, urinary problems etc. I think you should see a rheumatologist as soon as possible, because there are many good medicines available other than steroids Hope this helps and provides answers to your question.

    "answer": "According to the provided context, there are several potential health implications and contributing factors associated with blood clot risks. \n\nFor individuals with Factor V Leiden, they are prone to clot formation in the blood circulation system (Chat Doctor, 2nd query). \n\nSigns and symptoms of excessive blood clotting depend on where the clots form. For example, symptoms of a blood clot in the heart or lungs may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and upper body discomfort in the arms, back, neck, or jaw (Chat Doctor, 1st query). \n\nIn the case of a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg, signs and symptoms may include pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the lower leg (Chat Doctor, 1st query).\n\nFor individuals who have undergone a vein procedure with laser, they may experience swelling and require compression stockings to manage the condition (Chat Doctor, 2nd query). \n\nAdditionally, prolonged sitting or lying on bed further increases the risk of clots formation in individuals with Factor V Leiden (Chat Doctor, 2nd query). \n\nIt's also mentioned that the risk of blood clot dislodgement is high within 24 hours of extraction after wisdom teeth removal (Chat Doctor, 3rd query). \n\nIn the case of live blood analysis, clumping of blood cells may be a protective mechanism of the body and is not necessarily a cause for concern (Chat Doctor, 4th query).",

        "i fell down steps and my leg bent underneath me and the front part of my calf hit concrete steps and formed a knot.  i have been putting ice on it from wednesday thru saturday and bruise has spread about 9 inches by 6 inches. are there ways to tell of signs of a blood clot.  i have no pain walking on leg or anything like that.Signs and symptoms of excessive blood clotting depend on where the clots form. For example, symptoms of a blood clot in the heart or lungs may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and upper body discomfort in the arms, back, neck, or jaw. These symptoms may suggest a heart attack or pulmonary embolism (PE). Signs and symptoms of a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg may include pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the lower leg. These signs and symptoms may suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Signs and symptoms of a blood clot in the brain may include headaches, speech changes, paralysis (an inability to move), dizziness, and trouble speaking or understanding speech. These signs and symptoms may suggest a stroke. Regards Chat Doctor. ",
        "I had a blood clot in my leg after a vein procedure with laser in March.  Subsequent tests showed I am positive for Factor V Leiden.  I still have a lot of swelling and continue to wear a compression stocking.  I cant figure out if the swelling remains from the vein procedure or the blood clot and Im afraid that I will have to live with this kind of swelling from now on.  Is that the case for Factor V?  Is this continued swelling to be expected?Hi, Thank you for your query on Chat Doctor. Positive for factor V Leiden people are prone for clots formation in the blood circulation system. Symptoms will depend on the site and extent of involvement. Continue to wear stockings. Prophylactic use of anticoagulants like aspirin, warfarin may be required to prevent further clot formation. Prolonged sitting or lying on bed further increases the risk of clots formation. Consult the doctor for further advise on management. Hope I have answered your query. Regards.",
        "Today, 8 days after 2 wisdom teeth got removed on the right side, I lost a blood clot. I was rinsing with salt water before the dentist gave me chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. Was that a mistake. Im very scared. What should I do and when will I start to feel any signs of painHi....than for your query.  The risk of blood clot dislodgement is high within 24 hours of extraction. There are many reasons of blood clot dislodgement like repeatedly rinsing your mouth, sucking, hot food consumption, touching with tongue again and again. If you have used warm saline rinse within 24 hrs of removal of tooth then it may be a cause of blood clot dislodgement. If there is no problem then u should not worry about it. But if u feel any problem then surely go to your dentist he will treat accordingly.",

Thank You Doctor !!!Hello, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I understand your health concern, if I am your doctor I suggest you that it is the protective mechanism of the body. It is nothing to worry about as it is present in all the individuals, even in me. Whenever blood comes out of the body it gets clotted because of injury associated factor. Only anticoagulant will help prevent blood clotting. I will be happy to answer all your future concern. Thank you, ChatDoctorInfectious disease specialist. Wish you the best health at Chat Doctor."

Such pressures can bring depression in long term. If you or anybody has depression, she cannot work or study properly, and it should be treated. You may ask your doctor to give you an antidepressant or talk sessions will help. They should work on the stressors since they change the personality if it takes long. Headaches are intensified with these factors, so you should pay attention to them. Counseling is really useful, and it is a good start. Let me know if you have any question. I wish you a good health.

    "answer": "Excessive sweating during sleep can be associated with various underlying factors, such as infections (TB, lung abscess, heart disease), hyperthyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, lymphoma, and anxiety or apprehension. \n\nIn the case of a 26-year-old male experiencing excessive sweating during sleep, the doctor suggests that it might be due to the body regulating its temperature or removing toxins, and advises not to worry unless the weather is hot or the person is anxious. \n\nFor a 35-year-old male experiencing night sweats that smell of ham, the doctor states that excessive sweating is not abnormal per se, but it can be associated with certain diseases, such as infections, hyperthyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and lymphoma. However, the doctor also mentions that sweating can be a normal body mechanism.\n\nA 3-year-old girl experiencing excessive sweating during sleep is unlikely to have any underlying disease, especially if she is gaining weight normally and does not have any other symptoms. The doctor suggests wearing loose and minimal clothes at night and maintaining a comfortable room temperature.\n\nIn the case of a person experiencing excessive sweating during sleep after losing their job, the doctor suggests that the stress and anxiety caused by the job loss might be contributing to the night sweats, and advises trying stress management and relaxation techniques.\n\nAs for the impact on daily routines and overall well-being, the doctor in the case of the 3-year-old girl mentions that the child might catch a cold sleeping in a damp bed, but this is not explicitly stated in the other cases. \n\nThe doctor in the case of the person experiencing excessive sweating after losing their job mentions that they should seek professional help from a psychiatrist if they are feeling overwhelmed by their stress and related symptoms.",

I suggest you not to worry much. Sweating is a body mechanism with which body temperature is regulated according to the outside temperature. Body temperature is maintained at a particular level throughout. Sweat also remove toxins from our body. Exessive sweating or hyperhi Chat Doctor.  Anxiety or apprehension is another cause. Excess sweating is also possible on hot weather. Ask yourself. Is the weather hot? Am I anxious? If the answer to these questions are NO, then consult a physician for further diagnosis and treatment.

But sweating can be associated or (sign can be seen in) with this diseases like infections(TB, lung abscess, heart disease), hyperthyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, lymphoma ECBU never bother about above-mentioned diseases BCU if anyone who is suffering from those then other significant symptoms will also be present which helps in diagnosis rather than excess sweating.

        "My 3-year old has excessive sweating during sleeping. This does not disturb her, she sleeps well.

Is she gaining weight normally? Excessive sweating present only during sleeping is unlikely related to any disease, especially if she does not have any other symptoms and is gaining weight normally. Try wearing loose and minimal clothes at night(preferably cotton), and if using air conditioner, make room temperature at 25-28 deg. Take care. Hope I have answered your question.

Thanks for your query. Unpleasant Chat Doctor.  You seem to be going through a stressful period currently, due to the loss of your job. So, it is quite possible that your sleep problems are being caused due to your stress.  The night sweats can also be a manifestation of nighttime anxiety / panic attacks. However, there are also a few medical conditions which can result in frequent night sweats like hypoglycemia, certain infections, hormonal imbalances (such as in menopause), etc. The recent worsening of this sweating could also be due to the flu and the associated fever and chills.  So, I would suggest that you try stress management and relaxation techniques in order to tackle your stress. If you are feeling overwhelmed by your stress and the related symptoms, then you need to seek professional help from a psychiatrist. There are effective treatment options available - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help him overcome your stress-related problems. Wish you all the best. "

        "the biggest drawback of doctors or health care professionals in general is that they focus on curative aspects, rather than preventive. If theres a heart problem, they say ok well cut u up and correct the defect. But its my personal experience that they dont provide health education on how to prevent the heart problem in the first place. I know - I have faced it with a couple of my close friends who underwent surgeries. Life style related illnesses are largely the fault of the people - and the health professionals as well. Your take on this? Age: 38 yrs, female, 5 feet 3 inches tall, 57kg weightHi Ma'am With all due respect I want to say we all are living in 21st century which is an era of modernized and educated society with well-educated people. A person comes to a doctor only when he or she falls sick. I want to ask your good self that how many times have you visited your doctor in your good health just to take health education to avoid yourself from getting sick? Do u believe it's possible for a doctor to go to every household and teach every single person how to stay healthy. So please don't say that doctors or health care professionals are solely responsible. Let me tell me from my experience I have patients who have undergone bypass surgeries/ angioplasties whom I have spent hours of counselling with to tell them to stop smoking as it is not good for them, but they never listen. So was do u think who's fault is this? You are telling doctors just cut up, Ma'am let us imagine a scenario; Say you are coming to a doctor with severe chest pain what do you seek that time A treatment or a health education lecture ? Please do answers before you point a finger at someone do understand the gravity of the scenario. Thanks and Regards Chat Doctor. ",

Thank you for your help nnnjkiHi...there are two issues here which you need to understand so that you can explain it to the doctor.1. A patient who is not having seizures or symptoms with same medication dosage do not require change of medications. This might be your doctors' perception in deciding not to change the medication.2. A patients' medication is always weight based. In this way you can convince the doctors to change the medication. Regards - "

Im low in iron and vitamin C. second thing is i have a bump on my head thats been sitting there for years but it dosent hurt do you know whats problem? and can hep?Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Random bruising on body can occur due to many reasons. Vitamin C can cause easy bruising because of lack of collagen network to form a strong framework. Thus, a weak framework can lead to easy bruising and thus easy bleeding. Since, you are having easy bruising, vitamin C deficiency is probably the cause for it. Vitamin C supplements will help to restore vitamin C levels. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. ",
        "Hi doctor,I was told toda y by my doctors office that I have anemia.they want me to redo the test in one month. Ive been having small little brusing on inner arms some as large as an eraser and small as the width of a pencil lead. Ive also seen a bruise on my thigh the size of a quarter. Think there can be a connection?Thank you, MaryHi and thanks for the question, Is anemia is associated with easy bruising, the main possibility to be exploited and excluded is a bone marrow pathology, a lesion with the kidneys with inadequate secretion of a hormone called erythropoietin, responsible for both red blood cells and platelet production and a spleen defect. The platelet production is very much linked to red blood cells production. Low platelets generally lower than 50.000/mm3 could lead to easy bruising. A complete blood count with platelet counts measured is needed. If low again, the opinion of a hematologist might count significantly in the diagnostics and management. Thanks and kind regards, Bain LE, MD.",
        "Hi, i fell about 5 days ago at cheer leading practice on my knee/ shin and now i have a huge bruise on my shin/knee it is also very swollen.. The first time this happened was about a year ago and has happened about 5 times since then.. I and every time the bruising is pretty severe and spreads all the way down my leg.. I went to the doctor the first time and he said i had a bone bruise.. I was just wondering if its normal for it to keep happening.. I only went to the doctor about it the first time.. Should i go again cause it keeps happening.. Could it be something about my blood?Hello, Thanks for posting your query. Bruises can happen due to-1.) People platelet and blood coagulation disorders can bruise easily.2.) Being deficient in vitamin C, your more prone to bruise easily, due to weaker blood vessels.3.) Rare genetic disorder called on Hildebrand disease, which prevents the blood from clotting properly. This disorder affects at least 1% of the population.4.) Bruises in elderly people may be due to thinning of the skin.5.) Medications6.) Maybe you just hit something harder than you expected.7.) Heavy and rigorous exercise may cause bruises, which results from microscopic tears in blood vessels underneath the skin. Visit your doctor for further investigation and treatment plan according to it. Regards.",
        "Several months ago I would get a pain in my right leg and maybe a day after brusies would show up, this went on for about 3 months.  The leg pain stopped for maybe a month and now my right are was paining me and I have 2 litte red bruises.  What could be wrong?Dear patient thank you for your question. Here are a few causes of spontaneous bruising and some tips to help you figure out what you might have1) Blood disorder:a. On Willy Brandt disease/ Hemophilia: A blood disorder due to lack of coagulation factors. It results in spontaneous bruising and is easy to rule by a simple blood test called COAGULATION PROFILE.b. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count can result in such symptoms. A coagulation profile will help to diagnose this condition as well. Leukemia: My intention is not to scare u but practically speaking it is a possibility especially if u feel fatigued and have bone pain or headaches. Please get a complete blood profile done2) Liver disorders of your coagulation factors come from your Liver hence a Liver disorder mostly cirrhosis can result in such symptoms. Get an LFT done. Yellowing of your eyes/jaundice may hint at a Liver disease however it is not a rule3) Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin C and b12 deficiency can result in bruising as well. The test is time-consuming and expensive so just take a multivitamin tablet every day and see how u feel after 2 weeks4)Graces disease: This is a thyroid disorder and may be accompanied by excessive sweating feeling hot increase appetite yet wt loss. A thyroid profile is warranted. More common in females5) Excessive medication/ Injury: If you are taking any medication please read the label to see if hematoma or bruising is a mentioned side effect.Also, if you go to the gym or run a lot this can happen strongly urge you to discuss this with your go and reach a diagnosis. In the meantime for your pain here is what you can do1) Ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day2) Cold compression over the bruising3) Elevation of the leg while sitting down Hope this helped."

Thanks julia lloydHello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. There are numerous causes for Excessive fatigue, tiredness and sleepiness. It is very usual after a prolonged work in night shifts and frequent shift changing. Frequent shift changing and night shift usually alters our Circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm is nothing but a bodies physiologic and biologic clock. Blood pressure can be low in night shift workers and frequent shift changers due the disturbance in circadian rhythm. Some common medical condition you have rule out are Anemia and Hypothyroidism and Diabetes. Have a healthy lifestyle, eat in time, exercise regularly, try relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation, Spend enough time with your good friends. Plan and do the work so that you can not get frustrated or depressed. If still the tiredness and sleepiness is more, then you should consult a general physician and further investigation may be needed for the diseases which I mentioned earlier like blood check, thyroid hormone, blood sugar etc. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health.",

I think this is the case with almost all working mothers across the world. They have to take care of so many things, fatigue is quite natural. You also study. That adds up to the stress level.

I know you can't leave job because of the salary is the only income. So leaving study my give you good relief. Still better is, keep relaxed keeping your passion.

        "I had a endoscopy and colonoscopy done a couple months ago and they found 4+ ulcers and a polyp they would normally find in a 50+ year old person... and a few weeks ago I started having bright red blood in my stool. I have also been bruising easily and been feeling a little dehydrated and I would like to know what is going on with me?Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Bright red blood on toilet paper after you've had a bowel movement may be a sign of colon polyps or colon cancer, rectal bleeding can indicate other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears (fissures) in your anus. Examination by a doctor helps in confirming condition. Biopsy from polyp is necessary to snow type of polyp. Removal of polyp can be done through colonoscopy using snare method. Bruising is common in aged people due to thinning of skin and weakened vessel. As you have blood in stool and bruising need to get examined by doctor. Possible causes are if you are any blood thinning medications, platelet disorders or clotting system abnormality. Consult your doctor for further management Hope this helps you. Regards",

I looked in a mirror and there was an indentation with black skin beside it and the indention was bleeding.  Could it be cancer?  The ident and black skin hasnt gone away in a year.HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Blood in the stool can be related to different possible causes such as: (1) straining in constipation (2) anal fissure (3) colonic cancer-may be associated with loss of appetite, weight loss, constipation, abdominal pain (4) polyps in the colon (5)hemorrhoids (6)diverticular disease- out pouching of the intestine, common as a result of aging, non cancerousThough blood in the stool may be due to benign, non-cancerous causes, it must be investigated. You need to consider visiting your doctor who will examine your abdomen, conduct a rectal examination and likely suggest investigations such as fecal sample to the lab and imaging. I hope this helps",
        "i am a 19yr old boy.i am feeling unwell and as i used the loo i found blood in my stool.its already been 5 times.i am too scared.as i am alone at home i just don t know what should i do.i consulted with doctor and took medicine but there no any affect.as i am a student i have not attended any classes.i am in big trouble.can you please tell me how to get rid of this problem.Hi Milan, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Blood in the stool should not be taken lightly. The blood could have come due to injury to the rectum while passing hard stool, or it could be due to piles. These are not serious problems, but there are other very serious causes for blood in stool which can only be diagnosed by a Gastroenterologist who will have to do Colonoscopy to rule out any serious problem.Meanwhile, Chat Doctor. Do consult a Gastroenterologist immediately.",
        "I was wiping my butt & a clear liquid came out with a LITTLE bit of blood. Its been happening for about a week or so. By the way, I am a male. I dont have the healthiest diet but this has NEVER happened in the past. What are possible explanations for this?Hello! Thank you for the query. Bright red blood on the surface of the stool or on the toilet paper is very characteristic for hemorrhoids. Due to constipation, bad diet, steady lifestyle, veins gets enlarged in the rectal area what causes hemorrhoids. When wiping, you get hemorrhoids wounded, so it gives a blood. I suggest you to start with diet improvement. Increase fiber rich products and mineral water intake. Avoid fatty foods. Start probiotic supplementation. Remember to wash your rectum after every stool. If this won't help, you should consult a surgeon and have rectal examination. Hope this will help. Regards."

        "my abdomen feels hard and not soft when i palpate it...is that nromal? also why do I have thin (a bit thicker than a pencil) stools and very hard to defecate and not alot per day...almost feel constipated..been almost 2 weeks like that..im on naproxen and detrol..could these be the reason?Hi. This is not normal to have hard abdomen on self-palpation at all. Naproxen and metro can cause constipation. Hard pencil like stools are indicative of an anal stricture or an anal fissure. The harnesses on the abdomen can be due to xenoliths impacted all over the abdomen in large bowel. I would advise you the following:Get an examination by a General Surgeon, get a clinical diagnosis, get large bowel enema done along with the laxative to be taken in the night. Have site bath. Take probiotics. Avoid all the foods and beverages causing hard stools",
        "applying pressure when trying to pass stool in turn makes my penis eject out fluid and i also spend a lot of time trying to defecate. I allow the defecation to happen by nature and i dont put pressure trying to pass stool. I am suffering from constipation. Kindly helpHelloPassage of hard stool exerts pressure on urogenital organs which generally secrets and stores seminal fluid So that spells out due to pressure by stool loaded colon which further augments when you put strain during defecation. So you need not worry, correct the constipation, and it will disappear automatically You can take laxative or stool softeners in case of acute constipation you should take lots of fresh fruit and green vegetables with dietary finer supplements which will increase the roughage and facilitate smooth passage of stool. You should take plenty of fluids especially on getting up in morning have half to one liter other fluid mixed with lemon juice and honey Hope this helps you Please feel free to discuss further I will be happy to help you Best wishes",

Then in July extreme pain again where it had attached to abdominal wall.. needless to say recovery after surgeries these close back to back. Any suggestions to prevent these?? Didn t know I had to pay for answer.

And the degree of adhesion , he doesnt want me stuck in a always surgery situation.Hi, Thanks for writing in to us. I would like you to know that adhesions in intestines are a difficult problem to treat fully. As mentioned, multiple surgeries may be needed for the same reason. In your situation, adhesions appearing again is the first suspicion. It might be causing a subacute or acute intestinal obstruction. You have not mentioned which part of your bowel was removed. Not all adhesions can be seen on ultrasound and CT scan. Right now you must first get an abdominal erect X-ray done to see for any significant sub acute or acute obstruction. Following this the surgeon may put you on observation and pain medications or may decide to operate again if there is indication of the intestines getting blocked. The pains should be reported to your doctor and investigations completed at the earliest. Hope this helps",

Perforated bowel and intestinal adhesion can be caused by benign and malignancy. It is usually seen in benign conditions and only few cases are malignancy related. It will help to know if there is any mass or infection on CT scan that might be the cause for such a problem. Lowering of hemoglobin and hematocrit is a concern. Please get a peripheral blood smear done and this is a simple test to know if you have anemia and what type it is.DEXA scan is a low intensity X-ray to measure bone density. When there is bone cancer, the density of bone in affected area changes as compared to surrounding bone. This difference is bone density can be appreciated.",

If I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy and whatever tests and they are fine. How can they figure out if I have adhesions?Hello! Thank you for the query. The main problem with adhesions is that all tests and examinations can be negative and the only way to rule them out is surgery. Sometimes, abdominal CT with contrast (so called enterocolitis) can show some narrow areas of intestines but it doesn't have to. So it is advisable for you to have this CT scan and if it will come negative, you should ask a surgeon for help. Hope this will help. Regards.",

The adhesions can be seen on the CT Scan if they are well-formed. The secondary effects of adhesions in the form of intestinal obstruction with proximal dilated bowel loops can be nicely seen. Diabetes has to be under control and well managed for the best outcome of any treatment. I would suggest to under Enterocytes as it is better than CT scan and Ultrasonography to see the intestinal obstruction, kinking and so on. You may then definitely go for the next surgery as advised to you. Internal hernia can also give the similar symptoms but will be different on CT or Enterocolitis."

I now feel sick, achey and am starting to itch in various places all over.  My son (6) broke out in what looks like chicken pox this morning although he has already had it three years ago.  I have had chicken pox 20 years ago.  I am wondering if I have shinglesHi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Shingles is caused by virus varicella zoster. It is also called herpes zoster. Shingle occurs when the virus that causes chickenpox starts up again in your body.  The virus usually affects one nerve only and on one side of the body. Symptoms occur in the area of skin that the nerve supplies. The usual symptoms are itching, tingling, pain and rash. The rash could turn into clusters of blisters. Preceding to the appearance of these symptoms, you may have a headache and also feel like flu like having symptoms. Kindly consult Dermatologist for clinical evaluation and management. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",
        "My mother is 80 years old and has shingles. She has been to a doctor and has medication for pain. She is 3 weeks into the shingles and is  not getting any better. She is in extreme pain, shivers, tingling.  What do we do? Will taking her to the Emergency room be of any help?Thank you for contacting ChatDoctorI am sorry to hear about your mother has shingles as this can be a very painful condition. Shingles is a reactivation of an old chickenpox virus in nerve endings. Initially we start an antiviral medication at the onset of the shingles and then treat with pain management. We frequently use narcotics to help with pain and also use anti-seizure medication like gabapentin to help reduce pain and tingling sensations. This may take weeks to month to control. I recommend that you seek medical attention through her regular physician. Hope this answers your question. Please contact us again with your questions and concerns",
        "I have been applying salt water compresses to my mothers shingles rash.  What are the chances of getting shingles myself?   I had chickenpox in my childhood.  Should I get the shingles vaccine.    Will rinsing my hands in peroxide prevent the spread?Hi, Shingles are basically reactivation of chickenpox virus, anyone who had chickenpox may develop shingles. Shingles are contagious but less so than the chickenpox, but It's important to note that the varicella virus (chickenpox virus) is contagious not the shingles. That means direct contact with shingles blisters, would cause chickenpox in someone who has never been infected with the virus or someone who never been vaccinated against chickenpox. In simple words shingle cause chickenpox in close contacts and shingles never cause shingles in close contacts. Coming to your case, since you had chickenpox in childhood you are immune to virus, and you never develop chickenpox virus, and you can safely take care of your mother. Since you have chickenpox in the childhood you may develop shingles in adulthood, and it can be prevented by vaccination. So it's better to take vaccine. Rinsing your hands will definitely decrease the chance of contamination to others, so you should maintain good hand hygiene by frequently washing both hands.Finally, one more thing, once the blisters scab, shingles are no longer contagious. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

        "i was prescribed adderrall when I was younger, but quit taking it during j.r. high. in this past year I had recreationally taken adderrall 7-10 times. I had never had a problem with it before, until two days ago I had taken one and notice I felt like I was short of breath, and no matter how deep I would breathe in I couldn t get enough air. the feeling eventually went away so I didn t think to much about it. except I woke up today and took one early in the morning 8:00 and started to notice me getting short of breath again. Several hours later I noticed a tingling sensation in both my arms, It gradually became more severe then moved up to my face, my whole face, including my tounge. I went to tell my girl friend who was sitting beside me what was goin on and noticed I was slurring my speech and couldn t help it. I was going to go to the ER, but when I steped out the truck and started walking around it all jus slowly died down. So question is what could have caused that? and if it was just the adderrall why is it affecting me differently now?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of transient ischemic attack (TIA) is more. It is sudden occlusion blood vessels and thus stoppage of blood supply of some part of brain. So momentarily, that part of brain functions less and gives the symptoms of sensory disturbance (tingling), slurred speech, died down etc. So better to consult neurologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of Central nervous system (CNS).2. MRI brain 3. Blood pressure monitoring 4. ECG and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. 5. Cholesterol levels. So better to diagnose yourself first and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

I would like to explain that a transient ischemic attack lasts less than 24 hours and normally less than one hour. Your symptoms may be related to a transient ischemic attack or a stroke. I recommend you to go to the ER and consult with a neurologist, perform a careful physical examination, blood pressure monitoring, routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, ECG and a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical vessels). A brain CT scan or MRI scan if possible is necessary to establish the diagnosis. A transient ischemic attack must be monitored in the ER as an alarm sign for future strokes. The cause of this event should be investigated (by a detailed check-up), in order to evaluate the risk for future strokes and start the proper therapy to prevent this. Hope to have been helpful!

Please assist !Hi, The symptoms you have described here are commonly those that occur during a transient ischemic attack, though you haven't mentioned how the symptoms proceeded further. Have you completely recovered from it or if there are residual symptoms still? However, I would urge you to fix an appointment with a neurologist and discuss starting antiplatelet medications. It is very important that you see him immediately as there are increased chances of stroke following a transient ischemic attack. You will also need thorough evaluation along with Doppler ultrasound of your neck vessels to assess their patency. A CT too may be required while you are at it.",
        "2 weeks ago I had an instant numbness starting from my left foot all the way up the left side of my body to my face, following by a loss of taste then I collapsed when I got to emerg. After that I couldnt speak properly; I knew what I wanted to say but I was stuttering and slurring . They didnt do any scans and me me leave I couldnt speak right for 2 days. Last night it happened again with the numbness & speech, & I was nodding off but not falling asleep. Some are saying maybe a mild stroke but no doctor has scheduled a CT or MRI for me. I need answers ! Im a 22 year old female and really confused .Hi and thanks for the query, I think you need a careful review. This looks like a transient ischemic attack, a lesion due to reduced blood supply to the brain with spontaneous recovery. This might require a critical review of the family history, heart disease history, any notion of loss of consciousness in the past and epilepsy. It might be necessary to get a complete review from a cardiologist first, and neurological attention might be sought if necessary. Transient episodes of hypoglycemia could at times present as such and must also be borne in mind. It is compelling to a get a complete review by a cardiologist. Thanks and kind regards, Bain LE, MD."

        "My family has a history of cancer right from my father having Renal carcinoma and had been operated and doing well for the last 7 yrs and then my dad d sister who had beast cancer recently expired and there is one more aunt my paternal side who had cervical cancer / lung am not sure of.. now am scared bcos im 29ys old and my aunt who expired was a doctor had told me to get sonomammagraphy done as a regular check up and after 35yrs to get a complete PET scan done in order to rule out the disease . Could you please tell me what test are necessary for me to be done on a regular basis. Kindly give me the details of the tests that needs to be done in future as well. Thanks inHello, I can understand your concerns and anxiety with a family history of cancer.  Routine screening procedures are different for specific cancers.  For breast, it starts with self-examination for lumps and mammography after 35 years. For cervical cancer, you can start getting a Pap smear every year now. For lung cancer, cast x-ray is being now evaluated for screening.  There are a few blood tests that can cover for markers of cancer as well. All these procedures are available for low cost. There are a little cancer that can be caused by defects in genes, and they are transmitted within the family. A whole body imaging procedure such as a PET scan can be helpful in such situations. From what you have mentioned, it doe snot look like to be the case with your family. Since PET scan is a costly procedure, I would suggest you reserve it for the last and not as a screening procedure.  You can get it done once some time in the course and later on follow up with other routine procedures described above. Please go for the simpler tests first. Hope this could be of help. Regards.",

I can understand your concern. Screening test for cervical cancer is pap smear examination.  It is just screening test.  Confirmatory test is cervical biopsy and histopathological examination.

There is no absolute way of knowing positively whether you have had a seizure or not, unless it was observed by someone. The description of the seizure is the best way to diagnose it. Alternate way of testing for seizure, which you may have not done because it is infrequently found, is video EEG. Here you are monitored in a room for 24 hours or as per the protocol of the testing center. During this period, your EEG is recorded continuously. The chances of getting a finding are raised. However this may also be negative.I hope that answers you best of luck Chat Doctor. ",

My question is what could,be causing this???Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms and I appreciate the detailed description of symptoms provided by you. Based on that, the cause of seizures could be a structural lesion of brain. The location of lesion could be occipital region (located in the back of brain), in view of visual symptoms before the seizures. The lesion could be a granuloma (infection), tumor or vascular malformation. The diagnosis can be made by doing brain scans such as MRI or CT scan. I hope my answer helps.

At first ill inform you in summary about epilepsy and epileptic seizure, Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol with"

But a chronic anemia as well as some metabolic disorders could mimic this clinical scenario (or exacerbate the POTS symptomatology)So I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count (for chronic anemia)- Ferritin and hemosiderine plasma levels (chronic anemia)- thyroid hormone levels (thyroid function)- cortisol plasma levels (a Chat Doctor.

        "Hi, I am a 61 year old male in good health, slightly overweight but go to gym 3 times a week. I take blood pressure and cholesterol medication. I had a twitching eye for about 2 weeks. On Saturday I had a very sharp pain for a short period of time under/around my eye, and now the twitching has stopped. However, I am concerned this may be related to something more serious.Involuntary movement of the eyelids for a short period with spontaneous resolution is most likely benign and commonly occurs due to myopia associated with fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, excessive working on computer screen, sometimes after excessive coffee (>4 cups /day) etc. As it appears self-limited, it is of little clinical consequence. However, if it recurs, one may think of possibility of Multiple sclerosis(MS), as eyelid myopia may rarely precede MS.",
        "Our nearly 6 month old, completely healthy and happy granddaughter sways her head constantly when on her tummy or is being held. It is not because she is sleepy. At first we thought it was because her head / neck muscles were not strong enough, or because she was swaying to the music. She is sitting up fine,alone, though she still has to concentrate on sitting up. Her head is still when she sits up, perhaps because she is concentrating on her balance. One family thought is that perhaps her eyes don t move, so she moves her head to see! The baby s mother will ask at the 6 month check up in a week +, but we are interested in what you have to say.Hi, Is this associated with head tilting to one side, or any abnormal jerkiness (nystagmus) of eyeballs? When these three features occur together (head shaking, head tilt, nystagmus), it indicates a condition called spasms nu tuns, a benign condition that usually resolves in few months. All features may not be there initially, and may come in succession. In such cases I used to take MRI brain to rule out any abnormality and reassure the parents. Your doctor will discuss with you on coming visit. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",
        "My 7 year old son occasionally appears to be (in my words) stretching his eyes by moving them to the left or right. When I ask him about it he says there isn t an issue. Seems to be more pronounced after playing on the computer for an extended manner of time.Hello thank you for writing us here. Most probably it is because of muscle weakness which causes him to move his eyes in such a way. He would soon develop weak muscles if he continues using computer or put a lot of strain on his eyes. I would suggest you to take multivitamin capsules (it A more specifically) and abstain from using computer for long hours. And also go for exercises for eye muscles. It goes like looking right and left and up and Down for at least 10 minutes a day. Or you can go to an ophthalmologist for his checkup and exercises for eyes. Best regards, Chat Doctor. ",

        "I have read online that h pylori is transmitted through direct contact with saliva, vomit or fecal matter. Yet nobody states whether or not it is transmitted through direct contact with urine or blood. I know its dna is in urine and blood, but am unable to determine if it is infectious through those routes?HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The transmission of any infectious agents is also influenced by their survival in a particular medium. This means if the bacteria, e.g. H pylori, cannot survive in urine or blood then it cannot be transmitted in this way. The survival in the medium and in that aspect of the body is also important e.g. the urinary tract. H pylori is not normally transmitted via the urine or blood. I hope this helps",

Welcome to Chat Doctor, Diabetes is not a disease which is transmitted by blood contact. Diabetes is due to decreased insulin in the body either due to resistance to the insulin and decreased insulin. So it is not transmitted by the contact with the blood. Regarding urinary tract infection it is also not known to transmit by contact with the blood. Accidental needle prick injuries are known to transmit hepatitis B and C along HIV. Thank you",

If you do actually have it, the chance of transmitting to others is low except with blood or needle contact. It is not passed with casual contact. Please have retesting done as I have suggested to help know what you are dealing with. If you have the actual virus newer treatments are available to get rid of it."

        "I just got this flesh colored skin tag looking thing in the back of my mouth right in front of one of my tonsils. It doesnt hurt but sometimes makes it feel like something is stuck in my throat. I do have a tooth that needs extracted (right side of mouth as well) and im pretty sure its infected so i dont know if this flap of skin could be related to that or not. I just recently had a cold as well but my throat didnt hurt at all.Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint present of a skin tag in front of tonsil can be due to a number of causes like a lymphoid tissue aggregate, a mucous retention cyst or muscle, fibrous tissue overgrowth or irrational fibrous. Consult an ENT expert and get evaluated so that it can be diagnosed appropriately, and then only appropriate treatment can be done. In case if it is due to mucous cyst then salt water rinses can help in its regression while larger cysts needs surgical removal. In case of fibrous also surgical removal is needed. For lymphoid tissue aggregates also if there are bothersome getting them removed will be helpful in permanent resolution. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .",

As you are mentioning that you have skin tag present on your tongue, better you should visit an oral medicine specialist for proper examination and diagnosis. Based on your description there can be two possibilities for this skin tag, first it can be possible that this might have occurred because of trauma on tongue called as myogenic granuloma.

        "i have a very small skin tag coming out along my bra line in the front and under the tag i am feeling a small lump size of a small pea or so. is that normal because i had a tag once removed inthe same spot about 5 to 6 years ago but the lump is new.Hi, thanks for your query. Read and understood your history of surgery for the skin tag 5 to 6 years ago at the same spot where you have hot a skin tag now. Only difference is there is a small lump under it. Recurrence of the lump at the same spot after so much indicates that there is some irritation, and it is most probably the bra strap that is rubbing over the same spot over yeas to cause a lump called as papilloma. I would advise you in such a case the following. Consult a General Surgeon to get a confirmed diagnosis and get the swelling excised for two reasons:One, you get rid of the lump which is not a normal part of the body. Secondly, you get a confirmed diagnosis by histopathology examination the nature of the lump. Change the bra in such a way that the new ones do not rub at all on the previous spots."

I had a dentist check it out and she even took an x-ray but had no idea what it was though she told me no to worry about it. So the lump is still there and feels a little bigger and still hurts when I put pressure on it. Ill be booking an appointment with another dentist soon but was wondering if you may know what this may be? Thank you!!Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. The symptoms you mention in query are pointing towards a condition known as muscle or mucus retention cyst. Mucocele can occur when a salivary gland (like parotid glands) duct get blocked by some foreign body or by stone formation (also known as Sialolithiasis) . It is usually harmless condition. But if the lump is getting bigger and painful it requires proper medical attention. Because sometimes blocked duct get infected. I would suggest you to consult oral surgeon for proper examination. Doctor may order CT scan or MRI. Also, doctor should go for excision biopsy to rule out any malignancy. There are few treatment options for muscle like surgical remove or marsupilazation along with antibiotic course. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,",

I carefully read your query and able to find out your point of concern.Don't worries its not a serious issue to get worried. I think it is a muscle, caused due to local trauma. Mucocele are formed by accumulation of mucous from trauma to salivary duct. Usually it is not harmful and spontaneously resolve on their own after a short time, and you can rinse the mouth thoroughly with salt water for two to three times per day for few days to augment the process. If persist for long time then you can go to a dermatologist for laser treatment or surgical excision. I think it will help you. Wish your good health. Regards",

        "I am 26 years,5 7 and 72 kgs.I am diagnosed with mild MVP and have symptoms as palpitations,swelling of the nerves in the left palm.however I experience these symptoms in a cycle.I stopped weight training because I started experiencing panic,continuous palpitations.I am using betablockers 80 mg currently recommended by my cardialogist.Please suggest how can I lead a normal life.Hi noted all your details your symptoms are because of mitral valve prolapsehoweverMitral valve prolapse causes no problems for most people, so treatment is usually not needed. But in your case most likely severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse has developed, it is often benefited from surgery to repair or replace the leaky valve. For people with symptoms of congestive heart failure(swelling in arms) caused by mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation, surgery is usually the best treatment. But if there is no mitral regurgitation is present on echocardiogram, symptoms of mitral valve prolapse rarely pose any risk. The best treatment for each person may vary, but can include: Exercise Pain relievers Relaxation and stress reduction techniques Avoidance of caffeine and other stimulants your treatment and my suggestion fully depends on report of your 2d echo you can follow the treatment after considering the echo report yourself thanks",
        "I was diagnosed with mitrol valve prolapse about 30 years ago and my cardiologist told me to forget I have it.  Recently I have been experiencing a rapid heart beat at various times during the day.  It comes and quickly goes away.  I have low blood pressure.  I am under a considerable amount of stress.  I have been attributing it to that but am wondering if I should contact my internist/cardiologist for an appt.  Just had my yearly physical and ekg. 6 months ago and everything was normalGreetings! Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I carefully read your query. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. I would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but I am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. It would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with an atrial arrhythmia. And it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. My opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. However, if this is a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. Of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. As for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing a Chat Doctor.  There are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. If this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, I would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it. I hope I was helpful. Best regards. ",

        "I as told about 20 years ago that I have mitroprolapse valve. My mother had it and so do other members of my family. When I have a stressful day it really acts up. I had a heart monitor on yesterday and of course it was settled down and didn t do much. They took it off today and of course now it s really palpitating. And it makes me tired and makes me fell like I have to take deep breaths. Will some activity show even though it wasn t acting up. And if not should I ask for a different testHi, Mitral valve prolapse is a genetic disorder involving the Mitral valve. Treatment depends upon the severity of Mitral Regurgitation (leaking of the valve) and symptoms. If regurgitation is severe and the patient has symptoms, surgery (mitral valve repair) is indicated otherwise medical management is enough. Hope I have answered your query.

        "I saw the post from the mom of a child with a 12p12.1 deletion and was intrigued. I too have a son 9 y.o. who has been diagnosed with a 12p12.1 deletion and cerebral palsy. The geneticists at a top children s hospital had no experience with 12p12.1 deletion and could only find two other cases in the world in the medical journals. The geneticists nor the neurologist could tell us what to expect. The two cases found in the medical journal were apparently much more severe. My son has mild developmental delay, mild speech and motor delays, vision issues and has recently developed a movement disorder. He is able to run and play and is served under an IEP in the inclusion classroom to address reading, writing and math delays. I have done internet research and am concerned that I see genes in that region associated with cancer. Could this increase the likelihood of him developing cancer. Also, With the diagnosis of 12p12.1 deletion, would there not be another chromosome 12 (since they occur in pairs) that would contain the genes that are missing.Hello, Having a genetic deletion does not automatically increase the risk of cancer. Cancer is always multifactorial and genetics is a certain risk factor. Chromosome occurs in pairs. But sometimes gene requires two copies for normal expression to be produced. So one chromosome has deletion, end product won't be there. As there is limited knowledge in present deletion, not much can be commented upon. Now about risk of cancer - what cancer are we talking about. If we check ourselves, we would have plenty of mutated gene causing us high risk. As it has a multifactorial cause, cancer risk would be the same as most of us. However, better nutrition and healthy habits can still further reduce the risk. Hope I have answered your query. Happy to help, if you have any further queries.PS. Facebook seems to have a 12p mutation group - join and share informational care",

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. Weakness can come from different reasons. They might be cardiac, metabolic, endocrinoligic causes sect. To cardiac problems I would mention heart function or rhythm problem. If a person has a low cardiac output, meaning an insufficient heart and if he is untreated he might feel week and have different in breathing deeply. Also, heart rhythm problem might house weakness. Low heart rhythm, heart pauses or electrical system problem might be responsible for weeks, fainting etc. Electolit imbalances, thyroid gland dysfunction also might cause such symptoms. So, if I was the treating doctor I will recommend some examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze to exclude electrolyte imbalances, anemia, hypothyroidism and a holder rhythm monitoring to see your rhythm tendency during day and night. After all this we can better judge how to treat the problem. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor. ",

        "Hi, I am wanting to ask a question about my granddaughter. She is 6 years old, and weighs around 49lbs. She started complianing about chest pains about 6 months ago so we took her to the hospital . The doctors there ran a series of tests on her & came back to say she has Kawasaki disease. We just took her to a pediatric Cardiologist where they are now saying all 4 chambers of her heart had been leaking and that 3 of them were healing on their own but that the valve on the right side was still leaking so they want to put her on a monitor for 30 days to I guess find out what she is doing when the pain starts in her chest. Is this a bad sign for my grandchild? Does this mean that her heart is bad or that her problems could be fetal? I am so WORRIED about our granddaughter! Please could someone explain to me about the monitor & what to expect in the future for our grandchild! Thank you so much for any help! A worried GrandmotherHi... your granddaughter if correctly diagnosed with Kawasaki disease . Can be treated with medicines. The valve leak ... called regurgitation . Is usually mild and self resolving in most cases. The monitor (mostly a loop recorder, I guess) is for monitoring irregularities in the rate and rhythm of heart and if any changes in the heart blood flow (ischemia). Your granddaughter will surely be fine, and the disease is a treatable one.",

My dr. has me taking infusions each but I see no difference. Since I am getting worse, I was wondering about the life expectancy of someone with CIDP.Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. CDP is neurological disorder and progressive weakness is seen.2. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and prednisone is known to be helpful3. Life expectancy is variable. Spontaneous remission or relapses with remission can be seen. Response to treatment and severity is important for further prognosis. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.",

He is now running a fever and is on antibiotics and it doesnt seem to go away.  What would be the cause of this?Hi. I am glad we connected. Based on the symptoms you have mentioned, it sounds like your son-in-law may have had viral CARITIG. This is when a viral infection causes antibodies to be formed against the cardiac muscles or against the virus in the heart. One may also develop antibodies which attack the virus and the cardiac muscle. Depending on the severity, the treatment may range from plasmapheresis, steroids, or immune suppression. It would be best to confirm the exact treatment with your doctor or immunologist. Please reach out if you have any other questions. All the best."

B-cells are white blood cells present in the blood which are responsible for humoral response of the body to any infection. Humoral response is the production of antibodies which are specific to the pathogen causing infection and these antibodies attach themselves to the pathogen causing its death. Antibodies are usually immunoglobulins (IG). There are 5 types of Immunoglobulins in our body. Egg, IGA, IGM, IGE and ID. If there is a B-cell deficiency, there will be low levels of Immunoglobulins produced.IL-2, 4 and 6 are factors which are called cytokines which modulate the cell differentiation and hence affect the cell mediated immunity. Deficiency of these factors may cause depletion of both B cells and T cells. Thanks",

In my opinion there are many cases for absence of periods other than pregnancy like thyroid abnormalities, polycystic ovarian disease(POD), anaemia etc. As the ultrasound is normal the POD is ruled out. Kindly get a thyroid profile done to rule out thyroid abnormalities.Also, the hormone levels like LH and FSH are helpful in knowing the cause for absence of periods. Also get HE done to rule out anemia. Nothing to worry. Once the cause is treated the cycles become regular. If the estrogen is normal the progesterone hormone tablets help in inducing the menstruation. If there is no response with progesterone tablets then the problem might at higher level rather than at ovaries level. Hope this helps. Best regards...",

Usually there is absence of menstruation during pregnancy. Every month the egg or ovum is released and uterus prepares itself for implantation of embryo. If the fertilization doesn't occur the egg degenerates and the uterine lining is shed as menstrual blood. In case if the fertilization occurs the pregnancy results and there will be no periods during the span of pregnancy. After delivery the breastfeeding due to prolactin hormone prevents the period for 3-6 months. So the absence of periods during pregnancy is absolutely normal. Hope this helps. Best regards ...",

You can apply warm soaks around that joint. Try to straighten the finger within comfortable limits as much as possible. You can take Tab.

When I try to either straighten or to bend it feels like it gets stuck and the two parts of the knuckle are rubbing against each other. When it finally moves it is very uncomfortable.Trigger finger. Tendon usually glides easily through the tissue that covers it (called a sheath) because of a lubricating membrane surrounding the joint called the synovial. Sometimes a tendon may become inflamed and swollen. When this happens, bending the finger can pull the inflamed tendon through a narrowed tendon sheath, making it snap or pop and it some feels like locking. This can be caused by a repeated movement or forceful use of finger. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and diabetes also can cause trigger finger. So can grasp something, such as a power tool, with a firm grip for a long time.",

        "My shoulder will dislocate whenever I put a small amount of weight on it, but relocates whenever the weight is removed.

Having recurrent shoulder dislocations can be a problem.  Some shoulders will partially dislocate - this is called a subluxation.  These problems can either require intensive rehabilitation in the form of physical therapy or sometimes surgery.  Occasionally, we will order an MRI scan of the shoulder and take a look at the tendons and muscles in the joint itself. I would suggest that you consult with an orthopedic specialist to have your shoulder assessed. I hope this information is useful for you.

For recurrent shoulder dislocation you need further investigation and treatment. MRI may show Hill such injury or ban kart lesion. Hill such injury is bony defect, and you may need investigation and arthroscopy may need arthroscopic repair for bony ban kart lesion. You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case. You may need to take rest for early healing. After correction usually recovery occurs in 4 to 6 months. Hope this answers your query.

        "my 2-year-old has a small mole on her foot. it s solid-colored, dark, oval, and appears to have a slightly irregular border, although it s hard to tell because it s only a few mm in size. She has had it for about 1 year and it has been growing proportionately with her size. Should I be concerned? I just noticed the slightly irregular border because it is now large enough for that to be seen and I m wondering if I should rush her to a dermatologist or wait to talk to her doctor at her next appointment in november.Hi! Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor ! Moles have various appearances. It can vary in color from light brown to black, or it can be flat or raised. Most of the moles are harmless, but there are a few which can be cancerous. We usually observe the changes in the color and the texture as well as the irregular borders. We ask if it bleeds when touched or itch or if it's painful. It is best to have this scene by a dermatologist so she or he can have a baseline.  She will measure the mole, take pictures so on your next visit, she has a point of comparison to check for changes. I hope I was able to help you. Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrics",
        "I have had a mole since I was young. But recently I noticed that it has grown a little bigger. It is not round, and it is multi-colored . I am nervous that it may be skin cancer. I think I remember it being like this when i was younger as well, but I am really nervous about it being cancer.Hi, Thanks for writing in. A mole is an area in the skin surface where there is an excess of pigment deposition. Our skin gets its color from melanin pigment present in the skin. In a dark skin person, there is a higher quantity of melanin produced by the cells on the skin surface. In a light colored person, the melanin produced by skin cells is less. When the melanin is secreted in higher quantity in a particular spot on the skin surface, this gives rise to a mole and there can also be associated increased cell growth. The multicolor nature in a mole is due to the variable concentration of pigments in it. A mole is benign in most cases. However, if it develops sudden increase in size, appearance of hair on surface or pain sensation and ulcer formation then you should consult your doctor immediately. They will scrape the cells from mole surface if required and then confirm if it is a concern. Please do not worry.",

A mole is usually benign and harmless if it has been there for a while and the appearance has remained unchanged for months or years. Moles are very common and if your mole is a small one without any change in size or appearance in recent times then there is no concern. However, please consult your dermatologist if you have any of the following1. Change in size and appearance of mole over weeks2. Hair growth over mole3. Any wound or discharge in the mole4. Any other swelling in the body like the groin or above collar bone",

Sudden increase in size2. Appearance of hair3. Discharge in a more4. Change in color of motif the numbness is around 2 inches away from the mole then cancer is unlikely a possibility.

I am not a diabetic.Cellophane you for asking question. I am Chat Doctor.  Bad method of clipping the nails is one of the causes. Remember, don't clip you nail in rounded form. Clip you nail in a straight line and don't clip the sides which may grow inside the skin. Diabetes is a risk factor, but it is a common problem seen in non-diabetic and young patients in the department of surgery. The first line of treatment is topical and oral antibiotics. More commonly augmenting (amoxicillin clavulanate) is used as a first line agent. If condition doesn't improve within 3-5 days of the use of antibiotics then surgical removal of nail is an option that is usually considered. Usually problem solves after removal of the nail. The nail regrows., and you should adopt the necessary precautions. Don't clip the nails in circular line, clip them in straight line. I hope, you have got my point. Kind Regards."

And important is I have an sensitive skin . So I am not using any face cream. what is the probelm. Please solve my probelm Doctor. Thanking you ROSYHello and Welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. Common causes for having dark pigmentation under the eye are:-Iron deficiency anemia-Stress, anxiety or depression-Lack of sleep, poor sleep hygiene-Poor water intake-Smoking and alcohol -Chronic illness-Unknown causes (idiopathic). So, it is important to identify specific and treatable cause for best result. In most of the cases reasons for having dark circles below eyes are multiple and that's why multimodal approach becomes necessary for the treatment. General treatment consists of:-Iron and B complex vitamins-Apply almond oil around eyes in night-Put slices of cucumber above your eyes daily for 15 minutes-For stress (if present): daily morning walk, meditation and yoga-Proper sleep for 7 to 8 hrs per day, follow sleep hygiene-Plenty of water, fresh fruits, vegetables and salads intake-Using sunscreens: if your skin is sensitive for sunlight If above steps failed (which is less likely), then you should visit dermatologist for treatment options like: Medicines, Chemical peeling and Laser treatment. Best wishes,",
        "Hi, Im 13 and have a pale complexion, my under eyes are very dark and sunken in! My dermatologist told me it is like that because my skin there is very thin, which results in the appearance of my blood vessels to show. I have tried concealer, frozen spoons you name it... Is there any creams out there that could help my problem? Im just starting out teen years so surgery really isnt an option for me right now, being Im so young. But the appearance of the sunken in eyes are obvious. They make me look so tired! Any help; tips will be very much appreciated.Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your concern and I have understood it. Dark circles can be quite difficult to treat. Hereditary seems to play a significant role. In allergy prone individuals, a condition or state of atop exists & these atomic individuals more often than not manifest with dark circles under the eyes. It also depends a lot on your lifestyle pattern-diet, sleep, computer / TV use and stress. Stressors/ Strain due to working for long hours on computers & lack of sleep play a major role tooth under eye skin is also a factor in causing dark circles, the thin skin makes the blood vessels under the skin very prominent and hence this appears dark. You could benefit from using a cream containing vitamin K and Retinol(EGA cream). Use it once a day for at least 3 months to notice a difference. Another important cause of underage dark circles is Iron deficiency Anemia. As can be judged from some reasons cited, good HY Chat Doctor. ",
        "Hello doctor I am a 28 year old female. Would like to know an effective remedy for dark circles. I am anaemic but for the past six months, ive been taking iron pills (Ferric Ascorbate with folic acid) as advised by the doctor. Most of the other symptoms of iron-deficiency have gone except the dark circles. I do sit on the computer for most part of the day due to work, so cant really escape that. I am having dark circles since the age of 17-18. Please tell me how can i get rid of dark circles? I was thinking of trying melalite cream at night and doctor reddys niltan during the day time. Is that ok? Would also, like to add that ive been trying various home remedies as well but they hardly show any difference. Thanks,.Hello dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor.I have read your query and understood your concern. Dark circles is relatively a refractory condition. It takes really a long time before it shows good response to treatment. It may be due to familial causes, inadequate sleep, anemia, strain on eyes etc. In your cases, multiple factors are implicated. I will advise you to use safer segmenting creams around eyes like those containing comic acid, albumin, licorice etc. (like radiant i /under eye cream)I hope it helps. You may discuss this with your doctor. Stay healthy.",

Dark circles under eyes or under eye pigmentation is a challenging condition to treat. Its seen commonly in people having stressful life and irregular sleep and diet. It's also seen among people having atomic dermatitis and asthma. Sometimes its genetic due to deep sunken eye sockets in skull. Most of the OTC products are not very useful. I would advise you to apply tacrolimus 0.03% ointment at night and AVA RTA eye cream twice a day. Take oral It C regularly. Additionally, a series of chemical peels like arginine, lactic acid etc. from a certified dermatologist can help a lot. Try to de-stress your life and maintain a healthy schedule. Hope you will be fine to Take care Chat Doctor. "

        "Hello, thank you for your help! I am a generally healthy 19 year old male with a height of 6 0 and a weight of 145. I have been a cross-country runner for over 5 years, and have remained physically active into my college years. My diet reflects that of typical American teenager; however, it may be slightly healthier considering the fact that the only beverage I drink is water and I generally try to be conscious of my diet (less processed foods, balanced, etc...) I am concerned about my blood pressure. Two years ago I had my blood pressure checked, on multiple occasions, at 142/90. Yesterday I had it checked at 143/88. And today, at my town s clinic I had it checked at 138/88, although I was exceptionally clam today because I am on vacation. This is highly concerning to me because I believe that my blood pressure would be even higher while in classes. In college, I often consume caffeine (about 100mg daily) and occasionally (1X/week) take stronger stimulants such as nicotine, provigil or methylphenidate, although I do not have a diagnosis of ADHD or narcolepsy. I do this to accommodate my work schedule as I am enrolled in a highly demanding elite university. I know that I have a family history of hypertension; however, none of my known family members have had hypertension at such an early age. In fact, I had my blood pressure checked alongside my 71 year old grandfather and his proved to be lower than mine (141/86). I love life and I cherish the experiences that I am able to have as an average American Joe. I am interested in prolonging my life for as long as possible, and I take this threat to my health very seriously. I haven t yet tried drastically lowering my salt intake, and I am reluctant to abate my stimulant usage, however I am certainly willing to to protect my health. I feel as though I already exercise enough, and it is quite difficult for me to permanently lower my cortisol levels. I also take my sleep habits very seriously and nearly always sleep 8-9 hours/day during the same relative time such that I maintain a stable circadian rhythm. This is why I am really at a loss as to what to do. My home clinician didn t seem to take this issue very seriously and he just told me that I shouldn t be worried and that he would check it again in a couple of months; however, I want to be taking actions to lower my blood pressure now! What do you recommend? Is this issue as serious as I am taking it? If so, what steps may I take? Is it inevitable that I will have to be prescribed a medication? Thank-you for your time! I look forward to hearing your valuable opinion.Hi, if your blood pressure is high on successive occasion then u will check your blood pressure three times in week on one day gap in between. If it is higher than normal than u have to first go for serum lipid profile with cortisol level. If it is normal than start antihypertensive tablet for some time than measure your blood pressure again if controlled than gradually decrease dose of Chat Doctor. ",

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, here are some examples of potential benefits and considerations when seeking a second opinion:\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Getting a second opinion can provide a fresh perspective on a diagnosis or treatment plan, as seen in the context where a doctor suggests that a patient with lung abscess symptoms might have TB or lung cancer, and advises seeking a second opinion.\n* A second opinion can also help identify potential misdiagnoses, as in the case of the patient with pneumonia who was diagnosed with lung abscess but still had symptoms after treatment.\n* Seeking a second opinion can provide reassurance and peace of mind, as seen in the context where a patient is worried about a lump in their neck and seeks a second opinion after their brother was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* Seeking a second opinion can be time-consuming and may require additional testing or procedures, as seen in the context where a patient with a lump in their neck is advised to undergo an ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology.\n* A second opinion may not always lead to a different diagnosis or treatment plan, as seen in the context where a patient is advised to undergo a full lobe removal for a lung mass.\n* Seeking a second opinion may also involve additional costs, as seen in the context where a patient is advised to seek a second opinion from a specialist.\n\n**Influence on decision-making:**\n\n* Seeking a second opinion can influence decision-making by providing patients with more information and options, as seen in the context where a patient is advised to consider TB treatment for their lung mass.\n* A second opinion can also influence decision-making by helping patients to identify potential risks and complications, as seen in the context where a patient is advised to consider the potential risks of open stomach surgery for a blocked renal artery.\n\nOverall, seeking a second opinion can be a valuable step in the decision-making process, as it can provide patients with a more informed understanding of their diagnosis and treatment options.",

        "I have an AAA that is now 5.2 cm & stenting surgery is scheduled for early on 3/27. The vascular surgeon called me today and told me he discovered that I have two renal arteries going to each kidney when looking at the cat scan to estimate stent size. One of these arteries originates from the aneurism and will be completely and permanently blocked by the stent with some kidney damage as a result. He is not sure of how much damage or of how to estimate the risk, although the only option seems to be open stomach. I do not know whether to go forward or postpone until I can get a second opinion and if I do, should it be from a vascular or a renal specialist?Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. I am of the opinion that your first physician is right in admitting that it is difficult to predict the outcome pre procedure. In case you want to go for a second opinion, I am of the opinion that both the vascular and the renal specialist should together take a decision after jointly evaluating you clinically along with all the investigation reports. Thanks and good luck.",

Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.",
        "I have had a year long plague of pneumonia with reason not found . An opacity in chest right upper lobe was found . Two bronchoscopies and one needle biopsy yielded no results .. although my symptoms were fever , weight loss , shortness of breath and cough that doesn t stop .. TB tests were negative ..No specific bacteria or fungi found during this time. They diagnosed this to be lung abcess and finally docs suggested me augmentin for several months which did kill all the symptoms but the mass in my chest would not go away completely .. surgery was advised and they were going to do a lobectomy but ended up doing a wedge resection .. now after a month of healing from this I m still having same symptoms and a CT still shows a mass or opacity in the upper lobe (right) . Doctors are suggesting a full lobe removal but my point is I have been through this once with no results .. what are the chances that this is a misdiagnosis and I have TB .. should I take a second opinion and treat for TB ?Hello and Welcome to Ask A Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, you should definitely go for second opinion. Recurrent mass like lesion on upper lobe is mostly due to 1. Tuberculosis.2. Lung cancer. So empirical anti-tubercular Chat Doctor.  No harm in taking TB treatment. If mass is improving then no need to worry about cancer.

        "hi im cheerymeel from philippines, i just want to ask questions regarding with the condition of my mother who is diagnosed with endometrial cancer probably stage 2, our doctor told us to undergo my mom with chemotherapy before she proceed a surgical operation. is it right to undergo chemotherapy before she proceed with thw surgical operations?I am sorry to say that this is not the right treatment protocol for endometrial cancer. Normally, the first step in the treatment of endometrial cancer is surgery. If this we remove the uterus, both tubes, both ovaries, bilateral pelvic nodes and take a number of samples from various parts of the abdomen. We also take washings from the abdomen surface and send it for cytology testing. This is called a staging laparotomy as this not only is part of the treatment, it also gives the exact stage of the cancer. Depending on the final stage that comes after surgery, she may require postoperative radiotherapy. There is nor role of chemotherapy in endometrial cancer except in the last stage for palliation. You can visit nccn.org and see for yourself. I suggest you change your oncologist.",
        "Hi My mom has been diagnosed to be having endometrium Carcinoma...the clinical reports told its stage IC ...now the Biopsy report says its in stage II ....she has gone through hysterctomy and the doctors mentioned she has no issues...as it was localized only within uterus...still the oncologist has suggested a small therapy after 15 days...would like to know about her future....will ther be reccurnce..she is 59 years old and has slightly high BP due to anxiety ...and menopause stopped 10 years back....please advice...thanksHi. I can understand your concern for your mothers' health. Stage II endometrial cancer is cancer of uterus that is confined to genital organs in pelvis. Treatment after surgery includes external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy boost to vaginal stump. External beam radiation is delivered to pelvis and brachytherapy is delivered via a cylinder inserted in vagina for a short duration as vaginal stump is at high risk of recurrence. This treatment brings down the chance of recurrence from 30% to below 10% at 5 years in stage II endometrial uterine cancer. I hope your query has been answered. You can discuss this with the treating oncologist. If you have any further questions I will be happy to answer. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.",
        "I just had a hyster after a diagnoses of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Timor removed with good results and lymph nodes negative. I just learned I have atypical cells in pelvic fluid and Dr. Is recommending chemo and radiation. Is this the most common treatment?Hi, Thanks for writing in to us. Endomentrial adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the inner lining of the uterus. This is treated by surgery in the initial stages. Some patients also require chemotherapy and radiation therapy for proper cure to take place. As you had surgery done and lymph nodes were negative therefore it is possible that the cancer was still localized to the uterus; however in some patients the biopsy of the specimen might show severe grade malignancy cells and this needs to be eradicated with chemotherapy and radiation. If you do not take chemotherapy and radiation then it is always possible that the disease spread might occur to other adjacent structures and then there will be metastasis even in the absence of primary tumor. Cancer must be treated sufficiently so that it does not return. Please do not worry.",
        "Hi, I had endometrial cancer. A high grade endometroid adenocarcinoma with squamous differerentiation. I had surgery - removal of my uterous, fallopian tubes, ovaries, some lymph nodes, and part of my ometum. I had superficial myometrial invasion as well as cervical stromal invasion- invasion of cervical connective tissue. The maximum invasion was less than a millimeter. My lymph nodes, ovaries, fallopian tubes, peritoneal fluid and omentum were negative for malignancy. I have had a cat scan and mriabout 6-7weeks after surgery which also was clear. I am very reluctant to do chemo (1st try had a reaction right away) and radiation due to the severe side effects. I have completely changed my diet, I am slightly overweight and losing weight now though as I am eating mostly vegetables. I am eating very healthy and am reasonably active. I feel really good - infact better than I have in a few years.Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You had endometrial carcinoma with squamous differentiation.  You also had invasion in myometrium and cervix.  Treatment of choice is surgery followed by chemotherapy.  You have hone through surgery.  Now you should take chemotherapy. Take proper nutritional diet and healthy diet. You should also go for ultrasound abdomen every 3 to 6 months to detect early recurrence or spread. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly.

They assume the lesions are cancer and told me after surgery they will test it and add the sizes together so then my tumor size could be a 3 cm which would change my stage to 2.

I am so sorry to hear about this breast cancer. There would be no change in the treatment plan as stage 1 and stage 2 are treated in the same way. This consist in surgery and radiation therapy. Further treatment like hormonal therapy and chemotherapy would depend on the laboratory findings of the nodes and the receptors on the surface of this mass.

        "I saw the post from the mom of a child with a 12p12.1 deletion and was intrigued. I too have a son 9 y.o. who has been diagnosed with a 12p12.1 deletion and cerebral palsy. The geneticists at a top children s hospital had no experience with 12p12.1 deletion and could only find two other cases in the world in the medical journals. The geneticists nor the neurologist could tell us what to expect. The two cases found in the medical journal were apparently much more severe. My son has mild developmental delay, mild speech and motor delays, vision issues and has recently developed a movement disorder. He is able to run and play and is served under an IEP in the inclusion classroom to address reading, writing and math delays. I have done internet research and am concerned that I see genes in that region associated with cancer. Could this increase the likelihood of him developing cancer. Also, With the diagnosis of 12p12.1 deletion, would there not be another chromosome 12 (since they occur in pairs) that would contain the genes that are missing.Hello, Having a genetic deletion does not automatically increase the risk of cancer. Cancer is always multifactorial and genetics is a certain risk factor. Chromosome occurs in pairs. But sometimes gene requires two copies for normal expression to be produced. So one chromosome has deletion, end product won't be there. As there is limited knowledge in present deletion, not much can be commented upon. Now about risk of cancer - what cancer are we talking about. If we check ourselves, we would have plenty of mutated gene causing us high risk. As it has a multifactorial cause, cancer risk would be the same as most of us. However, better nutrition and healthy habits can still further reduce the risk. Hope I have answered your query. Happy to help, if you have any further queries.PS. Facebook seems to have a 12p mutation group - join and share informational care",
        "My wife has been diagnosed with PSP disease about 5 yrs ago. I am currently unhappy with our current doctor because we have been unable to see her.

I will no longer accept only seeing a PA we need to see a doctor. I am therefore looking for a recommendation for a doctor in or area who is up dated on the treatment of this condition. any advice would be helpfulHello, My recommendation is that you contact the Cure PSP society at https://www.psp.org/ for a couple of things. 1. Support information and local groups in your area for folks with PSP.  This is a terrific group of dedicated patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. 2. Check for Academic Medical Centers in your area that may have doctors who are more on the cutting edge of research and treatments in the area of PSP. Hope I have answered your query.

Looked up on the internet about gilbert s syndrome and found out it s not a desease and can t be even noticed and it involves inderect bilirubin because lack of liver enzymes little bit won t be processed and gets back into the blood, in my case all the bilirubin are elevated and my bowel movement has not been normal for more than 8 months loose stool with bad smells, could this be liver failure? is my liver not diggesting food properly? what s wrong with me? am I the only person in the world with these symptoms? lately i have been feeling stomach empty all the time even after eating please helpHi, Thanks, welcometoChatDoctor.

You remember vivid and interesting events most. Furthermore, you remember images and videos most. The best method to remember and recall maximum is to remove stress and anxiety from your life.

Minor forgetting like lists of items in shopping, programs by busy people is normal and is actually considered healthy and stress buster. You can talk to a psychologist for details.

I suggest you not to worry much. You must understand that memory power never goes down for a healthy young individual.

Reading two hours continuously without understanding anything or understanding 10% of what you read is waste of time and energy. Studying for 30 minutes and understanding 20 minute stuff is real reading. How to achieve this? There are several techniques. Search internet and you shall get many. 1.

I have gone through your symptoms, and in my opinion you judged it right such symptoms could be due to vascular phenomenon. The condition is known as Reynolds syn Chat Doctor.  The ways out are1 Do not let your hand get cold, use warm water, protective gloves, and be careful only you know what causes them and avoid them.2 consult a vascular surgeon and get investigated on any other because that may be there.3 some ",
        "in the last 2 months I developed a very odd symptom. The fingers of mind hand started swelling up mildly I could feel my pulse through my fingers not moving my hand and it was hard to close my hand, this usually lasts 10-30 minutes. After this happened quite a few times I was able to narrow down the common denominator. Any time I touched a surface with condensation on it, like a cold beverage container, or the side of a metallic ocean ship I would get this reaction. Normal showering, bathing, or conact with water doesn t seem to cause this affect at all. Do you have any idea what this would be?You get chilblains, are inflammatory skin changes by exposure to cold without actually freezing the tissues. BY chilblains skin tissues become swollen, red and painful. Cold exposure causes immediate vasoconstriction of arteries thus blood supply is reduced creating the symptoms. If I have to treat such a patient I will advise elevating the extremity and rewarming. Caution must be taken not to rub the area and apply heat directly over the fingers.",
        "I use 15 mg daily dose of Enalapril, 1 baby aspirin and 5-10 mg Zolpidem. I also take chondroitin/MSM/glucosamine combo daily.   I have occasional attacks of low peripheral circulation with cold hands and feet.  Is this the synergistic effect of the drugs I am taking and what would be an optimal drug use.Hello and thanks for writing. I can understand your concern and would try to help you in the best way possible. The Chat Doctor.  You are probably having Reynolds phenomenon, I suggest you consult a physician for a diagnostic workup and management plan. You may need additional medications like calcium channel blockers to prevent such episodes.In the meantime avoid cold exposure, keep your hands and toes warm and keep good care of your skin of hands and feet."

    "question": "How does the placenta function in supporting fetal development and what are its roles and significance in pregnancy and maternal health?\nBetter give me some examples.",
    "answer": "According to the provided context, the placenta's role and significance in pregnancy and maternal health can be inferred as follows:\n\n- The placenta's position can affect fetal development and maternal health. A low-lying placenta can cause bleeding during pregnancy, leading to fetal distress. However, in many cases, the placenta moves upwards as the pregnancy progresses. (From the first and second pieces of context)\n\n- The placenta's position can also affect the type of delivery. If the placenta is low-lying or previa, it may require a surgical delivery (LSCS), but if it's only 2 cm away from the internal OS, there's a chance of a normal delivery. (From the third and fourth pieces of context)\n\n- The placenta is formed at 12 weeks of pregnancy and grows with the uterus, pulling the placenta up into the upper segment as the baby grows. (From the third piece of context)\n\n- Regular ultrasound scans can help monitor the placenta's position and movement. (From the first and second pieces of context)\n\n- Bed rest and avoiding physical strain can help prevent complications in cases of low-lying placenta. (From the first and second pieces of context)\n\n- The placenta's position is not a reason for a cesarean section in itself, but it can be a factor in cases where the uterus has scars. (From the third piece of context)",

Till i never had bleeding. will this a big problem later? does placenta moves ? Can this problem create complications in delivery.Hello dear, i understand your concern. In my opinion placenta Pravda in early pregnancy might not be worrying thing. Because the placenta moves upwards in 90% of cases. But till that time you need to be careful like avoid lifting weights, intercourse,physical strain etc. Take strict bed rest. Regular ultrasound help in knowing the position of placenta. Persistence of placenta Pravda might cause bleeding before delivery leading to anemia in mother and fetal distress in the fetus. With optimum care complications can be avoided. So relax.

        "hi,i am 21 weeks pregnant but initially my doctors informed my placenta is low lying.it was around 1.1am anterior.but after my 20+6days Anomaly scan now my placental position is anterior high with the lower edge being 4cm away from the internal os.is it normal now?Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion your placental position is normal in position. Usual position of placenta is in the upper segment of uterus i.e., high. Presence of low-lying placenta in early pregnancy is a normal finding seen in a few women. As the pregnancy progresses the placenta position gradually moves up. If the placenta doesn't move up and remain in low position it is called low-lying placenta or placenta Pravda. When there is low-lying placenta there might be bleeding during the pregnancy leading to fetal distress. As your placenta has come to normal position you need not worry. Hope this helps. Best regards....",
        "hello dr in my 20th week scan the lady who did this scan she told me  that you have low plecenta .and in that case you have booken another scan in 36 week of pregnancy .so i ve to ask becausse of that am i not able to give a normal birth .and i m taking warm water with half a lemon juice in morning as a starter so because of this drink it happened because its my 2nd pregnancy in my 1st pregnancy i had not took  any this type of drink in empty stomach is that true plz reply mee soon i m so worring about cesarian .Hi, How are you doing ? Let me first tell you that NEARLY EVERY PREGNANCY WILL HAVE PLACENTA IN THE LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT. Placenta is formed at 12 weeks of pregnancy. There is no much growth in placenta after that, only the baby grows, so also the uterus. In early pregnancy as the space in uterus is restricted, the placenta which is a sponge like discoid structure will have some part of it in the lower segment. As the baby grows, the uterus also grows & it will pull along with it the placenta up into the upper segment. This happens normally. It is a big blunder to advise a cesarean section for placental location based on scan in 20 weeks. Only placenta in patients with scar on uterus (like Previous cesarean scar or removal of fibroid or any other scars will not allow the placenta to go up. Am sure next scan at around 30-32 weeks will show the placenta in upper segment. You can then have a normal vaginal delivery Chat Doctor. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if anymore queries the best",
        "Hi I have placenta posterior and placenta previa which reaches up to 2 cm. I suffered bleeding and I was kept in the hospital for 2 days. I am advices bed rest. I am in my 28th week. I wanted to know is it possible for me to have a normal delivery in this condition? Also what advice would u give so that there are no further complications to me or the baby And I can have a smooth delivery. Thank youHi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern. Placenta prefix is a condition when placenta is near / over internal OS (inner opening of uterus.  Type of delivery depends on how much placenta extends towards the internal OS.  - Low lying placenta/ placenta few cm. away for mos/ placenta covering margins of OS .have chances of normal delivery with expert management/ utmost care. But placenta sitting over internal Os inevitably turns into surgical delivery (LSCS delivery) * You are mentioning your placenta reaching up to 2 cm.  In case It's 2 cm away from internal Os. You do have chance of normal delivery.  But if you mean its covering internal Os. You have to have a LSCS deliver.  * Please don't be scared, whatever is the type of delivery. It should result in safe childbirth. So whatever your doctor decides it best for you & your baby.  Thanks."

MAY GOD/ALMIGHTY BLESS U.Hello, Thanks for posting your query, Pain due to gastritis can hardly be located where you have described the pain to be. The pain might likely be coming from your muscles and/or joints or lungs. So saying, you might be suffering from osteoarthritis or osteomyelitis, or fibromyalgia. However, it will be wise for you to see a doctor to actually do you a physical exam, so he may locate exactly where the pain is coming from so that he can know which tests to request. Treatment will depend on the cause of the pain. Hope this helps"

        "i wore magnetic earrings constantly and noticed after I would take them off, it would be swollen. then i stopped wearing them for about a week and noticed a small almost hard lump in both my ear lobes. its gotten smaller ive noticed but its still there. and i was still deciding if i should actually get my ears pierced at least until the lump gets smaller or softer. how are the lumps caused and can i still get my ears pierced?Greetings Madam. Feel glad that I am able to help you overcome your discomfort viz., soreness in ear lobes. My opinion after reading your query is that it is infection usually by bacteria of the tissue that surrounds and nourishes the cartilage(A tough, elastic, fibrous tissue) which makes up the outer ear. Common reason are injury to the tissue viz.,ear-piercing, etc., which may sometime leads to deformation of the ear structure (in severe cases). Other possibility could be Ear Keloid(overgrowth of scar tissue that follow skin injuries) & many more possibility. Cant explain more. Best advise not only for your betterment but also to avoid further complication is that fix an appointment with a Family Doctor/General Physician/ENT surgeon/General Surgeon, who examine the ear & decide the treatment depending on severity viz., antibiotics/surgery followed by antibiotics. Sometime plastic surgery may be needed to restore the ear to its normal shape. Well, it all depends on severity. I am telling most possible reason as i haven't seen you personally.Instead, guided you. For future prevention AVOID ear-piercing.note:Finally it's just a guidance. Not a definitive treatment as i haven't seen you personally. You've to realize that these are temporary remedies. We don't know what your exact condition is unless we see you personally. Consult your Doctor if you still feel uncomfortable in spite of knowing above possibility. Hope I guided you right & it helped.",

        "My Granddaughter had a baby girl on September 5, 2013.  The family (Grandmother, Great Grandmother and other relatives have been anxious to see the baby and her Mother.  She says she is too tired and too busy to see us.  She also has a 2 and a half year old daughter.  I feel that she may have some Post-partum depression.  Could this be possible considering what she is going through?Hi and thanks for the query, I am afraid she really does not present with the classical signs of postpartum depression. This should not be a worry at this point in time. Postpartum depression rarely has anything to do with affecting the relationship of the woman with her parents or immediate family. Isolation and feeling sad, failure to communicate and sleep disturbances are generally the commonest signs observed. In this case, it is difficult, and almost impossible, in my own opinion to think f postpartum depression. It might be interesting if you could move towards her where she leaves and works, or have someone persuade her you really need to see her and talk to her. I really do not think you need to worry for now. Feel good and kind regards. Bain LE. MD",

However, my boyfriend is always stressing on me or upsetting me he also said something last night that I really cannot forgive. He doesnt seem to understand that this stress is inevitablly going to kick start my depression as its already having a debilitating effect on me. I have been extremely lucky not to have many pregnancy symptoms, however when he stresses me out I have jaw pain, neck pain, back ache, and severe headaches (think they are migraines) and this is all down to him stressing me which makes me freeze up, get no sleep and irritates my TMJ disorder, causing the headaches (I never got them befoore pregnancy-and I dont want them to stay!!!) I have spoke to him time & time again crying begging him to stop. This is not just a matter of oestrogen levels rising he s alsways been this way with me. What can I do? Should I avoid him till my baby is due? He is doing more harm than good. Is there any literature out there specifically for this problem-making him see that he cant keep doing this-he needs to get his stress out elsewhere & be more empathetic towards me. He isnt given me any emotional support Im scared about the effects of cortisol on the baby- it causes all sorts of problems- doubles risk of still birth & other social/mental/emotional& physical problems. He needs to stop or get out!!!!!Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  Healthy pregnancy demands good nutrition, good exercises, good medication & regular pregnancy check-ups, good & optimum exercises under expert guidance & a happy, positive & sound mind. Deviation of any factor directly affects fetus.  You have a psychological stress problem, specially with a particular person. The management of such stress requires efforts from both of you.  You start with your own efforts Start doing meditation/ mind concentration regularly Take help of some Yoga guru in your town & start practicing it. Along with exercises./ few sittings of psychological counselor would help./ Try to avoid points of dispute with the person.  Take boyfriend to your doctor/ family counselor. They will explain importance of psychological stability & positivity in pregnancy. They will also advise him few methods to avoid dispute / he may be given counseling.  Thus try wholeheartedly & both of you will bypass the conflict & a happy companionship.  In case, he is not responding, you can think of avoiding him till you get delivered.  Thanks."

Thank you for your help nnnjkiHi...there are two issues here which you need to understand so that you can explain it to the doctor.1. A patient who is not having seizures or symptoms with same medication dosage do not require change of medications. This might be your doctors' perception in deciding not to change the medication.2. A patients' medication is always weight based. In this way you can convince the doctors to change the medication. Regards - ",

His INR is constantly changing is gets to high. Does diet play a part in his ups and downs????Hi, diet plays very important role in all diabetes and heart patients. e.g. if pt Is on diabetic medicines. But is taking mango juice or sweets or chocolates, his sugars will never be under control. Similar is for hypertension and heart disease. This will have implications that the medications are not working but in reality, the diet is not being followed and pt is non-compliant.

It is normally treated with metformin/gluconate and weight loss for most persons. If the person does not wish to conceive then an oral contraceptive pill which can normalize the period is used, if the woman wishes to conceive then additional medication to assist ovulation (release of a normal ovum or egg) can be used. You should continue with the gluconate and if possible consider losing any excess weight, a loss of 7 to 10 % will help. If this by itself is not successful in helping you conceive, additional therapies would be used I hope this helps",

Last year my 3d mammogram was normal. My maternal genetics are not positive. Mother - survivor of a 66 yr. old procedure (radical mastectomy from lobular carcinoma diagnosis) and a sibling post menopausal with a insuiti (sp carcinoma) type of breast cancer requiring a lumpectomy with radiation and chemotherapy. Two maternal aunts succumbed to breast cancer (post menopausal ages) and a maternal aunt survivor with double mastectomy. Afraid, yes. I have my ultrasound tomorrow a.m. (Not a smoker, took birth control for 3-4 years in younger years..Drink alcohol responsibly,) Appreciate feedback.When a suspicious area is seen on mammogram, it needs to be examined either by fine needle aspiration or biopsy. These tests would give definite answer of cancer. Just by having strong family history you need not have cancer. Since the risk is more, you need regular screening and anything abnormal can be taken care of. Once advise is that need to stop taking alcohol since alcohol enhances cancer risk. Instead of worrying over family history, best would be to get rid of risky habits.",

        "Hello Doctor, I am Roma, 23, single and working. I come from a gujarathi family but born and brought up in Maharashtra. I am writing to you to seek help for my brother and parents. My brother and parents are having a strained relationship. Brother is 31, married and works in US. Parents (mom aged 55 and dad aged 59) stay in Dhule, Maharahtra. Dad is a physician (M.D., M.R.C.P.) and mom is a housewife. Brother has developed a feeling since childhood that no matter what he does, his parents are never happy with his achievements and they donot love him. He says that they have always pointed out only the negatives in him and never ever appreciated any of his poistives. He recalls many trivial incidents from his schoollife to graduation to current, wherein he thinks his parents never appreciated his success. Also he feels that MomDad try to micro-manage things ( as they want every small thing to happen as they want only) and donot appreciate independent thinking. (Though I know that mom dad have always been very proud of his achievements. It s just that their way of expression was way different from what brother expected). After his marraige, there have difference between his wife and parents. Parents feel that their son should take their side. But brother does not feel that right. Mom Dad are of a very traditional outlook. And this might be also because of the kind of society thet live in. They think they are always right. They think that after going to US and after marraige, their son has changed a lot. They think that their son is arrogant and not matured to the level expected. So now the case is Mom Dad are sad that their only son is being good to them inspite of they having been do so much for him all life. And brother is sad because he feels his parents have never been happy with him inspite of all his efforts and he is now frustated by their behavior/expectations. The situation is not at all good for a healthy family. I know i should not interfere in these conflicts as that would just tear me apart. But having know both the sides, feel a moral responsibilty to try to solve situations. Though they always all tell me not to worry about these things. Hence i want you to help them sort out things.Can u help here? The problem is brother is here for diwali right now and is going back to US on 10th of this month. So there is not much time. Would it be possible for you to have some phone-discussions and email conversations with all of them individually or on conference call? thanks RomaHello Roma, I agree that you face a very difficult situation within your family. Just to make the environment better, your parents as well your brother has to make efforts. Your parents should understand that their son is a grown UO now and has the capacity to take independent decisions. So they should try and not judge or interfere with him. On the other hand, your brother should also take pride in that his parents have worked for his success in life. They are his responsibility and he must work for their happiness. Hope the situation gets better. I would be pleased to help you further if I can in any way. Thanks.",

I am trying to understand her, but i could not. What type of activities will i take for this problem?Hi, one of the best option for you is HEALTHY SEPARATION with family. It will help all of your family member to resolve their conflict. So discuss with your wife and if possible separation is best option. Second cause of familial conflict is communication gape and some real events, so improve your in-family communication, but it needs active efforts from your side and understanding of family member and also needs time... first option is better if possible."

        "Hi, recently my lips have been extremely dry, so i have been using medicated lip glosses that have helped in the past with only slightly chapped lips. I have had problems with severely dry lips in the past, but i cannot remember how i dealt with the problem. This time i believe the problem is worse, because my lips have become dark in color, almost a black, and they have been throbbing slightly. What can i do to restore them to their natural/ healthy state? Could the cause of this be an allergic reaction or severely sensitive skin? p.s. I have had problems with sensitive skin; I got eczema last summer.Hi, You seem to have chronic charities. There may be erythema, Chat Doctor.  You might have mild pain, burning and itching. There may be some cause. Lip licking might exacerbate the disease. Sundays exposure, cosmetics, lipstiks toothpaste, dusts...etc. might be responsible. Vitamin B complex deficiencies, anaemia or nutritional inadequacy might cause the disease... You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis and treatment of its cause. Have blood tests to rule out any internal disease or vitamin deficiencies. You may take folic acid 5 mg thrice a day with iron tab. Antibiotics may be needed if there is secondary bacterial infection. Apply antibiotic cream with mild steroid like mometasone. You avoid soap, cosmetics and lipstick for good and fast result. Avoid bad habit of lip licking, if it is there. Do not injure the lip skin with your nails. You might get good result after few weeks. I hope this would help you in your treatment. Thanks.",

        "I have been experiencing chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue throughout the week. I went to my pcp dr and she sent me to the ER. I had an EKG, chest xray and a CT. All came back negative for heart or lung issues. Dr diagnosed it as inflammation of the chest wall. I ve noticed that I keep burping and the pain occurs after a belch, even if I just drank water. Is this an important symptom that I need to share with my pcp since I m still having chest pains?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease). Your symptoms of burping and belching are suggestive of HERD. Your cardiac and respiratory work up is also normal, so HERD is more likely in your case. GERD is due to laxity of the Gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these for HERD.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Take proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bed.",

        "i have shortness of breath and weak legs this has developed after I had a cold and seems to get worse my pulse has also increased from normal from 50s to 70s and at one time over 100 a few days ago. Is it bronchitis that will go away or should I go to the doctor?Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. The causes of dyspnea might be different. It might be a pulmonary problem, bronchitis, pneumonia BHT it also might be a cardiac problem. A viral infection sometime might affect the heart, her function, might affect pericardial layer and give pericardial effusion and this might be responsible for dyspnea, tachycardia. So, to clear all our doubt I will recommend you to have a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function, exclude pericardial effusion, a blood analyze and a thorax x-ray to see pulmonary situation. These will help to better understand what is going on and how to ménage it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor. ",
        "Doctor, I have had shortness of breath for two years. No one has found any reason why. I also have Hashimoto s Thyroiditis and Fibromyalgia. My D.O. found that I was anemic last year as well. He also found that I tested positive on an Anti-DNA test. He went on to test me for Anti-SM and Anti-Ro as well as for proteins in the urine. These three tests were negative. I kind of gave up on finding out what was wrong and just decided to live with it. However, I am concerned about the chronic shortness of breath as well as a new disturbing symptom. Two days ago, I woke up with severe lower back pain. It has not abated. I have made an appointment with my D.O, but it s not for another 3 weeks. I ve searched online and put the symptoms mentioned above through a Symptom Tracker. The thing that keeps coming up in response is Multiple Myeloma. This is really scaring me. I am only 43. I have two small children, ages 3 and 7. I do not want to have Multiple Myeloma. Also, The Anti-DNA result still means the jury is not out on Lupus, right? Could it be Lupus? Does Lupus cause lower back pain and Dyspnea? Does Lupus frequently occur with Multiple Myeloma? Do you think I might have Multiple Myeloma? Thanks, Andrea S.Dear Friend, Thanks for sharing your question. Following possibilities can explain your dyspnea: (1) Anemia (2) Lupus. Lupus can cause it by different mechanisms. You need to do X-Ray, Lung Function Test and HRCT to diff the same. Are u hypertensive also? There is nothing in your history (except backache) and investigations s/o Myeloma. You should also work up for other manifestations of Lupus. Hope I could add Chat Doctor. ",
        "I seem to have hard time breathing when I step out of the shower.  I also seem to uncounciously \"hold\" my breath, more like a breath very slow and shallow and my mouth is closed alot.  When climbing stairs, if i think about it and breath its a lot easier, but usually my breathing is labored after a flight of stairs.Hi thanks for asking question. Your physical examination is necessary with auscultation. First rule out common condition for dyspnea that is anemia...PS examination with HE estimation done.... Second here dyspnea while staircase walk. So if any cardiac history or hypertension history present then ECG or echo done to rule out early stage of heart failure.... Thirdly if no cardiac cause then respiratory causes worked out by chest x-ray and pulmonary function test ... According to cause treatment done... If nothing found abnormal then psychogenic or panic attack by stress investigated.... Take care....",
        "Lately Ive been having a hard time breathing out of now where.Its not that I cant breathe, its that I cant get a full deep breathe, which in turn leads to me feeling very dizzy like Im going to pass out. Im 25 yr old female..I do not smoke and I just had a baby 6 months ago. My husband is currently deployed and I do not know what I wrong.HI I can understand your concern. Noted you are complaining you can't take full breath... Here you have some social issue also. So if you are taking excess stress then by panic attack such dyspnea can occur. So if you are taking stress try to avoid it. Regular exercise and yoga good for that. You can take behavioral therapy for it... Second if it is not stress related then I would suggest you to first get your respiratory examination from nose to larynx by rhinos copy and laryngoscopy ... Sometime this can be psychogenic cause. So for that psychiatric consultation done. Even if still cause not clear, to rule out restrictive disease pulmonary function test done... Hope your concern solved.... Chat Doctor. "

Based on your query, my opinion is1. Dizziness, fainting is usually caused by hypoglycemia or anemia.2. Hypoglycemia means Chat Doctor.  Get your blood sugar level checked.3. Anemia needs to be ruled out. Get a Hemoglobin level checked along with red cell indices.4. Transient ischemic attacks can be causing you these problems. This needs to be evaluated. Get your Blood pressure checked to rule out hypertension.5. Also get a lipid profile done to know your cholesterol levels.6. Chest pain can be due to angina or gastritis, so ECG is needed. Hope this helps. Regards",
        "When i was 17 i started having fainting spells...they would come on real quick with dizziness, nausea, and feeling like someone turned the thermostat up in my body! I was diagnosed then with what they called Near Syncope and was told it would go away with age. Sure enough after the age of 19 it disapeared almost as quickly as it started. Now at the age of 26 its like it s back with a vengence only worse. I say worse because i don t pass out. Passing out made it better because i didn t remember the almost agonizing dizziness and i was almost fine after waking except for being very fatigued. Now...if i don t eat almost immediately when i think i should or feel just the tiniest bit of hunger...i get this rush of feeling hot, dizzy, very weak, and trouble focusing. Normall eating would make this go away...but lately food has not come to my rescue. Unfortunately this has been happening every day for the last week and i m becoming very bothered by it and almost afraid to even get up in the morning. Help!Hi, Your symptoms are suggestive of a couple of different things that could be going on which involve the induction of what are known as vasovagal symptoms (with or without syncope or fainting) by a hypoglycemic state.  Or you may be experiencing diurnal excess secretions of insulin through over activation of your parasympathetic nervous system which should be investigated by a GI specialist.  There may also be hormonal imbalances in your body that could be considered in this workup which could ultimately lead to your presentation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",
        "I had my breakfast this morning, lunch at lunch time then a snack...about 20mins ago I got bad tummy cramps , sicky feeling, shakes and blurred vision . I get this feeling often, it usually feels like I m about to pass out but if I dive for the chocolate/lucozade quick enough it usually passes off within 10minutes. It s clearly not hunger as I m eating plenty. I have noticed that recently I m not sleeping as well I should be; I struggle to sleep but once I m asleep I can t get up..I have to set 5 alarms in the morning for work and am late regularly. It s all just stressing me out. What s up with me?Hi there ~ symptoms such as yours i.e. eating something and subsequently having cramps, having a sickly feel, shakiness and blurred vision seem to me like they are related to a gastrointestinal condition.  Feeling of passing out or passing out after food also needs medical attention.  I suggest that you see a gastrointestinal (GI) physician.  However, if it is stress, and you need to elaborate on the kind of stress please feel free to do so here, I may have answers for you.  Alternatively, speak with a psychiatrist or psychologist about your stressors.  I hope this helps.  Take care and have a good day !",
        "i suddenly became very lightheaded then extremely nauseous. though i did not vomit, my tongue started to feel numb. what happened to me? i have recently been around people who had a Stomach bug that was going around, but none of them ever mentioned anything about their tongue feeling numb, also i feel fine now so i m not sure i caught what they had.Hello, If this was just an episode, you should not be worried much more than necessary. A sudden change in blood pressure, for example, may cause such symptoms. If your symptoms persist, it is a possible infection of the gastrointestinal tract since there are other people affected. In such a case, you should see your Doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, I'll answer your questions.\n\n1. How old until my beard is fully grown:\nOur growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time. It all depends on the family pattern and genes which we carry from our ancestors. So, basically it will be depending on your parents side.\n\n2. Will acne prevent hair from growing on that spot:\nNeither acne nor acne scars and creams prevent the growth of hair. None of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general. But if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face.\n\n3. Does acne cream stop hair growth because of the chemicals in it:\nNone of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general.\n\n4. Do acne scars without a doubt mean a bald spot for my beard in that scar area:\nBut if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face.\n\n5. At what age should I expect full growth:\nOur growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time.\n\n6. Why does my beard grow slightly quicker when I exercise:\nYes due to exercise we do have a bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth.\n\n7. Is the increased testosterone from exercise the reason for faster beard growth:\nYes due to exercise we do have a bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth.\n\n8. Is the facial hair growth I'm experiencing due to the Skinlite cream:\nThe hair growth is most likely due to usage of skin lite cream. Skinlite cream is a prescription product for pigmentation/plasma over face. Skin lite cream contains a potent steroid, mometasone.\n\n9. If I stop using the Skinlite cream, will the hair growth resolve:\nOnce stopped the hair growth would resolve gradually, may take up to 3-6 months to resolve.\n\n10. Can Depo Provera cause facial hair growth:\nThe mechanism by which it occurs is due the inhibition of the FSH and LH hormones from a part of the brain. Thus, the further release of female hormones is inhibited and that is how it is effective in birth control.\n\n11. Can facial hair growth be prevented:\nI don't know.\n\n12. Can facial hair growth be reversed:\nI don't know.\n\n13.

        "Hey, I am a young male that recently turned 20, my question is about facial hair, my facial hair seems to be growing slowly and I am just worried that, like a few people I know will only grow in certain patches and stop there, how old until my beard is fully grown, will acne prevent hair from growing on that spot, does acne cream stop hair growth because of the chemicals in it, do acne scars without a doubt mean a bald spot for my beard in that scar area. At what age should I expect full growth, also, I think I have noticed my beard growing sligthly quicker when I exercice, this beeing from the raise in testosterone I assume right? I know my questions are a little all over the place, I would really appreciate an asnwer to all of themHi Many, Welcome and thanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor. So you are worried about the growth of facial hair (rather beards) in uniform manner. Now to solve your queries:1. Our growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time. It all depends on the family pattern and genes which we carry from our ancestors. So, basically it will be depending on your parents side.2. Neither acne nor acne scars and creams prevent the growth of hair. None of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general. But if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face.3. Yes due to exercise we do have a bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth. Lastly there is no medical treatment in this world which can cause growth of hair in only beard area and your questions are exactly the same which a young man have (and even I had when I was at your age) so don't worry and be happy.With the best health and beard wishes, Chat Doctor.

        "hi sir i am using skin lite since 6months my face is looking gud if i apply it before day orelse it is looking black and i can see some hair growing on the face and upper lip, is that this hair problem on face is just becoz of this skin lite cream?Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor The hair growth is most likely due to usage of skin lite cream. Skinlite cream is a prescription product for pigmentation/plasma over face. Skin lite cream contains a potent steroid, mometasone. It should never be used on face for long because a potent steroid like mometasone can cause the skin of face to become photosensitive, Acne ridden and thinned out with telangiectasias. Females can also have facial hair growth (Hirsutism) which is an additional problem. I would suggest that you stop using this cream. Once stopped the hair growth would resolve gradually, may take up to 3-6 months to resolve. Regards",

I am now really stressing as I never thought of having hair on my face! help pleaseDear is the facial hair growth was not like this earlier, you must report the side effect to the gynecologist. The mechanism by which it occurs is due the inhibition of the FSH and LH hormones from a part of the brain .Thus, the further release of female hormones is inhibited and that is how it is effective in birth control.

        "Hello, I am 20, just under 6 feet tall and roughly 170lbs. I have been trying to participate in No-shave-november but as usual my facial hair does not want to grow for me. Will facial hair eventually grow faster or do I need to get used to a life without a beard? Does this have to do with genetics? If so, which relative should I look at to see what my facial hair will eventually come out looking like? (Ive heard if you want to know if youll be bald you should look at your monthers father).Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  You are right. Facial / body hair growth is a genetic issue.  No treatment can alter that issue. Please do not fall into the hands of some cheating people and lose your money. There are a lot of positive points for this condition. Be satisfied. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

And what are the treatments for it as I would love to become a mommy before my 30s (I am currently 27). Thanks.HAI, In PID you will likely to have lower abdominal pain, especially on either side of your bladder, even tender, and sometimes you may have dysphonia, pain during intercourse and pain during vaginal examination when your doctor moving your cervix. If you don't have all these symptoms you may unlikely to have PID. CHLAMYDIA can be treated by DOXYCYCLINE capsules for a period of two weeks. Your sexual partners also should be treated simultaneously. Otherwise, it is useless. PID may lead to bilateral block of your Fallopian tubes and may lead to infertility. So check yourself for pat-ency of your tubes either by laparoscopy or though Hysto-salphingogram. If it is cleared you'll become a mother. Good luck.  Chat Doctor. ",

But im wondering is one month of this pian can make me become infertileThanks for posting you query to Chat Doctor. As I understand you are worried about your fertility.there are so many infectious causes of PID, and it is not always necessary that PID causes infertility but resistant infection for months with some organism may lead to infertility. Presently in your case i don't feel that you will be suffered from infertility in 1 month infection.However, I would like to know that what investigation you have undergone to diagnosed PID and what treatment you have taken. If you didn't undergo any investigation I would like to suggest you following investigation :1.USG abdomen .2. Gram stain and fungal stain of vaginal discharge, if discharge is not present than for vaginal swab can be taken .3. Blood ELISA for TORCH test.review me after hope you are satisfied with my answer.

        "Hi, I was diagnosed with PID last year after being admitted to hospital with sepsis. Before I was admitted My symptoms were abdominal pain, pain with sex and bleeding after sex. All these symtoms are now back but have had blood tests etc and no signs of infection. When I was admitted with sepsis all my bloods still showed no signs of infection. What should I do?Hi there, PID means pelvic inflammatory disease, and it could be the inflammation of the fallopian tube along with the uterus and also the inside of the abdominal cavity. Infection causes inflammation and when it heals with the help of antibiotics or on its own it leaves behind scarring or in this case adhesions which may occur between the different organs present in the lower pelvic region. These adhesions cause pain whenever the organs are moved due to having sex or any manipulation of the external genital organ. The bleeding post sex need s to be evaluated with the help of a PAP smear exam to rule out any cervical pathology. You may visit your gun and get yourself evaluated with the help of an ultrasound to rule out any other pathology. If there are adhesions they need to be freed which can usually be done microscopically or by open surgery if required. Do get yourself evaluated. Take care."

There are various options available for treatment of keloid. First treatment modality is intraluminal corticosteroid injection that is given once every 4 week. It is less painful and safe. Laser treatment also gaining popularity. But it is costly and several sessions needed for its removal. Freezing the keloid (cryotherapy)is helpful in removal of it, but it will lead to some time dark pigmented scar that look cosmetic ugly. Interfeone injection also can be given. Some surgeon using fluorouracil and steroid injection together to be injected. Silicone sheets also can be available, but it has variable result. Besides this main treatment modality some home base therapy also available like applying baking soda paste made with HY Chat Doctor. Lemon juice extract, aloe vera can be applied over it. Rose water. Honey and lavender oil local application also can be applied. I hope I have provided you complete list regarding treatment modality.thanks.",

        "my boyfriend told me yesteday that at the GUM clinic he had been told he had symptoms of chlamydia, I know i never gave it to him and he swears hes been faithful. i also found out that he has had it in the past, could this be why he has these problems now. PLEASE help this could make or break our relationshipHi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria chlamydia trachomas, and it easily spreads because it often causes no symptoms.  In fact, about 75% of infections in women and 50% in men are without symptoms. Hence, it may be unknowingly passed to sexual partners. Symptoms in men produced due to Chlamydia include the following:1. Small amounts of clear or cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis.2. Pain during urination.3. Burning and itching sensation around the opening of the penis.4. Pain and swelling of the testicles. The condition can be diagnosed by use a swab to take a sample from the urethra in men or from the cervix in women and then the specimen is sent to a laboratory to be analyzed. Treatment is by administration of oral antibiotics with azithromycin or doxycycline. It is recommended the partner(s) also be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread of the disease. It is very important that you always use condoms during sexual intercourse to lower your risk of contracting or passing on infections such as Chlamydia. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",

There should be at least a 7-day period of no sexual intercourse after the antibiotics are used to ensure there is no reinfection. All medications are associated with potential side effects, but risk associated with untreated chlamydia are more than those with medication. Side effects may or may not occur, most use with no problem at all. I hope this helps",

Do you think I might have contracted other sti or std?Hi, Thanks for writing in. Chlamydia causes inflammation of the epididymis, a structure inside the scrotum (sack that holds the testicles) attached to the backside of the testis (testicles). Signs and symptoms include red, swollen and warm scrotum, testicle pain and tenderness which is usually on one side, painful urination, frequent urination, painful ejaculation, painful intercourse before ejaculation, lump in testicle, swollen inguinal nodes (lymph nodes in the groin), discharge from penis, and blood in the semen. If you have taken treatment and do not have any of the symptoms then there is no need to worry or get checked further.

        "Case history:-72 years old patienta sizable intra-abdominal mass occupying the right hypochodrium. Ultrasonography and Ct scans gave the impression that the mass may be extrapancreatic or related to the uncinate process. The mass was also indenting the IVC but was not infiltrating it. He had no jaundice and was of reasonable body status. Guided FNAC was done and suggested undifferentiated adenocarcinoma as the pathology. Bearing in mind that there was a solitary liver lesion at segment VI, Limited exploration was performed with the hope that this lesion me be GIST tumour and the possibility of having the primary resected may help the patient. Unfortunately the tumour was found to be purely pancreatic invoving part of the head and encroaching on duodenal lumen and inseparable from IVC. In view of the previous findings only anterior gastrojujenostomy was performed to the patient to avoid future duodenal obstruction. His recovery was smooth apart from attacks of bilious vomiting probably related to the gastrojujenostomy. He has severe anorexia probaly related to his malignancy. He is now suffering from severe anorexia + cachixia+Regular vomiting (Fluid therapy is applied regularly)The surgeon is advising to perform another surgery to make a tube outside the body to give him food through it.  kINDLY GIVE THE ADVICE REGARDING THIS OPERATIONNB.Doctores did not decide to give him any kind of chemotherapyHello dear. I have gone through the details. Si it seems an unresectable pancreatic cancer with a suspicious liver lesion. Approach would be to do an FNAC of the liver lesion if it is metastasis then do palliative therapy. If no then do initial chemo or radio chemo to shrink the tumor and make it respectable. Since pancreatic tumors cause severe cathexis and loss of appetite and also patient is vomiting, it is a good approach to do a feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy to provide adequate nutrition. You can go for this operation. Rest of the approach I have mentioned. Hope it is clear. Thanks",

It's not a malignant pancreatic cancer you have been reading about, just a simple tumor that can be removed and 100% cure is obtained.

She also continues to loose weight and she is not well.Hello, The reason for the liver biopsy is to find out the homogenous (via blood) spread of the underlying pathological condition of fungi.

So is it routine, do they need to ask permission. I remember it being very painful, I saw it being done on the screen. My Doctor says the results will not be in for about 2 months. What knowledge can be gained from a biopsy? Thank-YouHi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. In biopsy, they take some tissues from suspicious areas and then tissue is sent for histopathological examination and further studies.  If only histopathological examination is there then it will take approximately one week for report.  If UHC studies are also there then it takes 3 to 5 days for.  From report, we can search the cause like cancer or benign polyp or ulcerative colitis etc. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.",

Thanks for the query. There are some morphological features which indicate malignancy and doctor can guess that it is cancer. Of course to be 100% biopsy must be done. But doctor have experience and in many cases then can determine what kind of tumor it really is even without further tests. But whatever it is, biopsy must be done, and further treatment depends on it. Wish you good health. Regards"

Subconjunctival hemorrhage happens due to break of small blood vessels in the white part of the eye. The bleed is not absorbed quickly and might take some days to resolve. Isolated subconjunctival hemorrhage requires no specific treatment and heals in 2 weeks time. A subconjunctival hemorrhage changes colors and will fade from often red to orange to yellow over days. Patients often report a scratchy feeling in the eye and using eye Chat Doctor.

Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I read your question carefully and understand your concern. I would like to explain that your symptoms seem to be related to an eye disorder. You should know that chronic uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause chronic changes to the blood vessels supplying the eye and the retina (known as hypertension retinopathy). This disorder can lead to small hemorrhages in the eye, which can cause this symptomatology. Other eye disorders (like a corpus vitreous detachment) could mimic this clinical scenario. I recommend consulting with the ophthalmologist and performing a fundus oculus (which is part of the ophthalmological physical examination), to establish the diagnosis. Hope to have been of help!

        "i have had a gastro virus like symtoms for 2 months now lost over 10 pounds, different types of diarreah and a LOT of loud noisy gas....just read about the cyclospora outbreak and wonder....no doctor has found anything yet and I do not want a colonscopy are there others with this kind of thing??Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor Cyclospora infection can cause diarrhea, bloating, weight loss, loss of appetite, nausea. It is caused by infection by a parasite. The infection is detected by the examination of several stool samples over the course of a few days. More than one sample is needed because the parasite may not show up in a single sample. If you suspect this and live in an area where the infection is prevalent then you can consider sending samples to the lab for assessment. Colonoscopy however would be able to take a detailed look at the colon and determine if there are any other factors that may be causing your prolonged diarrhea such as inflammatory bowel disease. I hope this helps",

        "hello,I hit my head in December during the skiing. i had a head concession. Now, after 5 months of that i feel my neck is stiffed or some sounds in the neck when i move it, especially when it is cold. It can be connected to the concession that i had 5-6 moths ago? should i have a check up again? Especially what kind of check up and where, and what do you advice me to do? THANK YOU in advance.Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised along with MRI of cervical spine. As you are getting stiffness in the neck region and some sounds when you move the neck, it is related to the weakness of the muscles of the cervical region. Getting a Neuromuscular assessment of the cervical spine should help understand the cause. Also, with simple physical therapy and guided exercises for the neck muscles should give better results. In my clinical practice majority of patients having complaints of stiffness of neck region is due to weakness of the muscles of the neck and with physical therapy majority of them responds well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. ",
        "Yesterday I slipped on my icy deck and fell down the stairs. I hit my head, neck and back on the stairs. I have been icing my neck and taking 600mg of ibuprofen. This morning I woke up stiff and when I move my head up and down I have a shooting pain down the left side of my back.What should I do?Hi, I read your problem. Any injury to the neck like ligaments and muscle injury called sprain or strain leads to pain and stiffness over neck. A stiff and painful neck may be treated within a day, but firstly we will have to rule out that there is only muscle strain or sprain or any fracture? If the stiffness of neck doesn't subside within a week it needs medical treatment. But some treatments are:- REST - Take rest for one or two days so that the injured tissues of neck could be healed, which in turn will help to relieve the pain and stiffness of neck.- STRETCHING - The stretching will help to ease the stiffness and restore the movements of neck.- MEDICATIONS some medicines like ibuprofen and naproxen which are NSAIDs can be a first line treatment of neck stiffness and pain.- HOT AND COLD FOMENTATION - Cold therapy or ice packs can help to relieve neck stiffness. Applying the heat fomentation would increase the blood flow which leads to better healing environment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

The pains are also immediate onset with no prior warning and may last up to weeks. Sometimes it feels as if a bone is poking me from the inside.Thanks.Hello, Although you have not mentioned your age and your occupation, the symptoms you have mentioned are possibly due to stiff neck which occurs due to cervical spasm secondary to disc prolapse. I would suggest you to undergo physiotherapy for pain relief and also to strengthen your cervical muscles. If the pain and stiffness still persists, then please consult a local orthopedic. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

Also I am a side sleeper. Should I be worried or look for a better pillow.Hello, Stiff neck may be due to cervical spondylosis or neck muscles spasm or meningitis. Until examination is done, it is difficult to say what it is. Avoid pillow while sleeping, use tablet Zanaflex once a day for five days. Use cold and warm compression. If symptoms not improved please get an X-ray cervical spine then consult your physician. He will examine and treat you accordingly. Hope I have answered your query.  "

It develops slowly, due to that diagnosis is delayed in most of the cases.

Thanks for posting your query on Chat Doctor! Many people do have similar craving for different substances, including ice. Medically we call it Pica. Pica is generally a symptom of anemia, either iron, zinc or Vitamin deficient. I would suggest you get a complete blood checkup done, to exclude anemia. If anemia is confirmed, treatment will range from a daily dose of supplementation, to blood transfusion, depending on your levels not anemia, then the craving could be related to another condition named obsessive compulsive disorder, in which the underlying emotional factors, if any, need to be ad Chat Doctor.  Excessive ice cravings can also lead to weight fluctuations. So please do check up on that. Hope this helps.",
        "HI, I am a 45 yr old female and I have high blood and cholesterol i take antidepressants (zoloft ) and med for my hi blood pressure and cholesterol.  I recently had some blood work done and my hemoglobin level is at 7.7. after doing some reasearch on the internet, i am finding that eating ice can be causing this anemia. i do eat ice constanly thruout the day and drink a great deal of water.My question is can eating ice be causing anemia?You have a moderate grade anemia. You have high BP and cholesterol. Eating substances having no nutritional value e.g. Clay, Ice is called PICA and is considered sometimes a sign of iron deficiency anemia, though there are controversies regarding this. This may be associated with some other psychological disorders. If I were your treating physician I would have suggested you to undergo some blood tests including complete hologram, ESR, reticulocyte count. That may help to find a way to diagnose the pathology behind your anemia and if possible can cure you. Wish you good health.",
        "I have been having right side pain for 2 months now along with nausea, fatigue and appetite loss. The pains range from sharp and stabbing, tearing, burning and stinging, mild to severe, My temperature has gone all the way down to 94 degrees and up to a fever. Some days the pains are not so bad but constant and other days the pain is so severe and I cant stand up straight and can hardly move. The pain gets worse with deep breathing, a lot of movement, being hungry, eating, some days I do nothing unusual and the pain gets super severe. I have had an upper abdominal Ultra Sound, An upper UGI with barium and they botChatDoctore out normal. The doctor said those were to test my gallbladder but they did not find gallstones. They have not mentioned appendicitis. I am wondering what is causing the pain. ThanksHello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. This is a very peculiar history. Nausea , fatigue, loss of appetite are due to PAIN. Now the nature of pain. Pain threshold is different in different persons so at present keep it a side. As temperature goes down i.e. 94 F i.e. HYPOTHERMIA. Hypothermia obscures most of the symptoms and signs of INFECTION, notably fever and leukocytosis. Excessive, extensive cultures and repeated physical examinations are essential. As I mentioned above Infection may obscure, so we have to consider for abscess in Liver in initial phase, tuberculosis of intestine, Kidney functions (MAIN EMPHASIS over this). Once again get in U/S whole of abdomen at least from 3 (three) different centers and then consult a doctor who will match these reports and adjudge what is the disease. Once again I would advise you please get in Blood for E S R (C B C). Good luck ",
        "I am having some unusual problems. It starts off with the feeling of a bladder infection. Then I get a sharp pain in my left back.

The stomach remains this way for a period of time. I have been to so many doctors and they cannot figure this out.

Go for routine and culture of urine check up. After report go for long specific antibiotic medicine course.

        "Hi,When I sit on chair or lie down, I feel numbness in my hands and legs. And I always feel something strange in my body, like jijijiji. Which part of my body is touched with something, it start numbness on that place in a minute. I visited lots of doctors in different countries but they are unable to find the cause. If you please help me ?Thanks,AKMHello understand your concern. What you describe is called a paresthesia, an odd sensation when a particular area of your body is touched.  There are multiple causes of paresthesia, including neurological, vitamin deficiencies and even psychological. If you have seen many physicians already, I assume you had blood tests to check thyroid, B12 level, calcium level, magnesium level, iron level, as well as kidney and liver functions.  Some liver and kidney conditions could cause paresthesia. Also, some autoimmune diseases cause similar symptoms such as lupus or polymyalgia rheumatic. Next is to get electromyelograms with nerve conducting velocities of your arms or legs.  This will help identify any problem with your nerves or muscles. Some types of naturopathies cause parasomnias.  Do you have any medical conditions or are you on any medications that could cause these symptoms? The causes as you can see are varied. You can also see a pain management specialist who can help with the paresthesia. I hope you feel better",
        "I get full body paresthesia when lying down after around 45 minutes. Mainly during sleep. It wakes me up at around 4 in the morning. It goes almost instantly when I get up. The paresthesia can be removed from a part of the body - say the torso - by rubbing it. It then increases it in other parts of the body. I can progressively isolate it simply to the hands, Rubbing the hands together will remove it altogether for around 5 to 10 seconds but then returns usually back to the hands but sometimes back to other areas of the body. It cannot be removed totally without getting up. It s often accompanied with mild tinnitus which also only occurs when lying flat. Have spoken with 3 GPs a cardiac specialist (referred by a GP) and no one has a clue of the cause. I say paresthesia but there is no pain, no numbness - just a sort of high speed vibration and warmth inside the limbs.Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms seem to be caused by anxiety or a neurological disorder. I recommend you to consult with a neurologist for a careful physical examination. A nerve conduction study may be necessary to exclude a possible neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Although this disorder would cause pain and numbness (which you don't refer to experience). Thyroid hormone levels may be necessary to exclude a possible thyroid dysfunction, which can cause similar symptoms. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings! ",

There is no pain, what so ever, just a weird sensation. What could this possibly be from?Hi, From what you have mentioned, you are under some form of stress and the symptoms that you are experiencing are highly likely to be due to anxiety. Anxiety often leads to weird sensations and this seems to be on of them. I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist for complete evaluation of your problems. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like paroxetine would be effective in controlling your anxiety. You should also start exercising daily as that that will help you relax and feel better. I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Wishing you a speedy recovery."

Well while Bipolar disorder may develop in a person who has past history of anxiety and depressive disorders, but you should also take into account the fact that based on a single premise of mood swings one cannot be diagnosed as Bipolar disorder as there need to be a cluster of symptoms present together for formalization of this diagnosis. I am mentioning below some core symptoms and signs of Bipolar disorder which will help you to understand better about this condition.1) Elevated, expansive mood, also called as infectious gaiety.2) Inflated self-esteem and increase sense of self-worth.3) Overconfidence in one's abilities.4) Delusion of grandiosity and feeling superior over others.5) Over-familiarity and dis-inhibited behavior.6) Hyper-sexuality and promiscuity7) Decreased need for sleep (sleep only for 3 or fewer hours) but still one is able to get up with full energy8) Hyperactivity9) Flight of ideas and pressured speech that is ones ideas are produced in the mind at a fast rate so much so that ones speech is not able to complete one topic but before that jumps to another topic thereby making the speech incoherent and incomprehensible.10) Poor judgment and lack of insight, investment in doomed business ventures and going on spending sprees.11) Mood swings So you see you got to have few of these symptoms to be able to get diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, one single symptom does not support the diagnosis. I hope this helps. Regards",
        "Hi, My son just told me he is bipolar and is taking 3 medications for it. I don t know how long he has had it. He has been in therapy with his girlfriend for 2 years. they have a 11/2 year old little boy. How important is family therapy if he hasn t told me about his disorder until now. Is this something that I totally wait for him to share what he may need/want from me. We live in the same town. I looked over the few articles online here and have found out he is taking two of the first two meds talked about in the articles. He sees his psychiatrist once a week. His girlfriend sees someone else, but just as often. I guess I m just looking for any- you should do this now, or you should ask this now, or just wait for him to share more. He s 34 and in AA for 3 years, but now I m not sure the drinking was on hold for the full 3 years. He was a Marine for 5 years from 21-26. He has worked for the USFS maintaining back country roads with a crew of 6 for 6 years. With the baby he stopped that and is going to school in Aug. using the GI bill. Thanks for any insight you might give me. JanellDear serve understand your concerns went through your details. Bipolar disorder usually requires long term treatment, and therefore you should encourage your son to undergo treatment from the same psychiatrist to make sure there is always a pattern in the treatment. The psychiatrist may be needed to use the trial and error method according to the severity of the symptoms. Along with the psychiatry medicines, psychotherapy is also essential.

This is caused by decreased urine output, which leads to fluid retention, causing delusional hyponatremia and hypokalemia.\n\nAdditionally, the third context mentions that the patient's lower than normal sodium count after a liver transplant may be due to electrolyte imbalance, which can be caused by liver transplantation, kidney insufficiency, or low salt intake.\n\nThe fourth context also mentions that the patient's low sodium, potassium, and chloride levels may be causing their symptoms, and that taking an electrolyte concentrate helped alleviate their symptoms.\n\nThe fifth context mentions that the patient's Anion Gap was higher due to their blood pressure medicine losartan, which may cause RTA (Renal Tubular Acidosis), and that changing their medicine to amlodipine helped alleviate their shoulder pain.\n\nThese examples illustrate how the body's mechanism for maintaining electrolyte balance is crucial for overall health and physiological function.",

        "I am a 78 year old man, I have COPD, CHF and a multitude of other issues. I take up to 3 lasix daily and use lactolose and prune juice to regulate my bowels because I am on a 75mg Duragesic patch and supplement Oxycodone for pain from back surgery which cause severe constipation. I am in a wheelchair but able to ambulate to and from a sitting position. I am experiencing a number of new symptoms such as muscle weakness, hot forehead, overwhelming weakness to the point where I cannot get out of my chair, lethargy, and weight gain. My urine flow has greatly decreased even with the increased dosage of lasix. I have very hard stools which end up with severe diarhea. I am concerned about my electrolyte balance. Could any of my new symptoms be caused by and electrolyte balance? I am under the care of a cardiologists and multiple other specialist but haven t talked to them about these new symptoms.Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, you are right about electrolyte disturbance as a cause for your new symptoms. Your symptoms like lethargy, muscle pain and weakness are mostly due to low sodium (hyponatremia) and low potassium (hypokalemia). So better to get done sodium and potassium level. The reason for this is mostly decreased urine output. This causes fluid retention. This fluid retention causes delusional hyponatremia and hypokalemia. It also causes weight gain. So better to consult nephrologist for electrolyte disturbance and decrease urine output. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",
        "Hi, I recently had blood tests showing low levels of Vit B s, Magnesium, underactive thyroid, low DHEA etc. I am a type 1 diabetic but eat pretty good. I had a vit B12 shot at the Doctors office yesterday and felt pretty good. Around 4:00 today I started feeling a crash. Now my muscles are tight and kind of numb. I already took 350 mg of Magnesium. I m getting cramping in my feet. Could it be due to the B12 leaving my system? He just gave me a test dose and said it would be out of my body in a day or two. Am I taking too much Magnesium and not balancing it with other electrolytes? Thanks,Dear friend, Greetings from Chat Doctor... I understand your concern ... YOU GOT IT RIGHT you need to take care of all the electrolytes ... Check your serum sodium/chloride, potassium / ionized calcium ....because, low potassium/ calcium could be the reason ... you don't take magnesium supplement alone .... you have to consume a product which gives you all the vitamins and minerals together in a balanced form (nutritive daily / revival etc., ) you have to take good amount of green leafy vegetables, fruits, nuts, (banana & coconut water rich in potassium)...daily ... to meet the needs of minerals for your system ... thank you . Do contact us for more queries ...",
        "My sister had a liver transplant (last September) and now she is having lower than normal sodium count. She is hopitalized while doctors are trying to find out what is causing this situation. She is in an Indianapolis hospital that specializes in liver, kidney and eye transplants .Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor and I will try to help you as much as I can. Liver transplantation is extensive surgical procedure and electrolyte imbalance is common complication. Liver is organ that excretes hormones and enzymes required for sodium absorption and here some imbalance may occur after transplantation. Second cause may be kidney insufficiency and third too low salt intake. In every case, sodium can be replaced intravenously, and extensive tests are required to identify exact cause. I am sure doctors will find it. In general, this is not big deal. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.",
        "My problem begin around April this year. I had visited my primary doctor for a few times and did not solve my problem. So I try to solve by myself by looking all of my blood test result and searching from internet. My beginning problem is waking up in the early morning (only sleep 3 hours) about 2:30 am when feel the shoulder joint bone reducing and it disappear right away after standing up no more sleep and it come again when I go to bed to sleep again. After one month it developed to litter pain on shoulder to wake me up in the early morning. My doctor said that my thyroid function is normal because TSH 2, T4 0.85 . the vitamin d 28.9 little lower but I already took the vitamind3 2000iu more per day and my doctor said it is about enough vitamin d3 now but my problem even become more serious. I then went to emergency room because feel stress sex needed , short breath, and high blood pressure . Doctor want me bring all of the blood test result back to see my primary doctor. He did not say anything but no infection . I feel I am dying and no help because the following days is independent day and holiday. By overview my blood test I had found Sodium 135 (lower), Potassium (3.3) lower, Chloride95(lower), CO2 (25) normal, Anion Gap 15 (higher). I think I am lack of electrolyte, and buy the electrolyte concentrate to dilute with water to drink. After I drink a big cup of electrolyte water I feel much better no more stress. I continue my internet search about why short electrolyte and found that I need take more sea salt food and potassium food and I continue to search why Anion Gap higher. I had found my blood pressure medicine losartan may cause RTA and cause Anion Gap higher. After I take off my blood pressure medicine losartan and take amlodipine in stead of it , my shoulder pain disappear that night (My blood pressure medicine is amlodipine 5mg and losartan 50mg generally, now I change to take amlodipine 10 mg ). I had solved my shoulder pain but I still wake up in the early morning can not sleep enough. I think I might have Hypothyroid problem. By self-test of early morning 1st wake up temperature of my body , 95.2 F , 95.1F, 95.F. From the book if the body temperature in this self test is lower than 97F is hypothyroid. So I think now my problem is hypothyroid . I am looking for how to solve my condition. Thank you for reading and looking forward to your advice. fHiI would advise you don't study much on net as it would confuse you as a layman. Go to a physician with trust and get proper advise to follow. Electrolyte imbalances do occur time and again, so does body temp fall.97 is quite normal. Just eat routine diet and juices and fruits and take prescribed medicines. There is nothing to worry from medical point of view. Self-analysis is dangerous and depend only on your treating doctors opinion, you will live and shall be okay best wishes"

Any behavior which causes significant distress or impairment in a person social, occupational, personal domains is usually characterized as a disorder. Similarly, if a particular behavior (ripping toenails) is causing significant distress to close ones, family members can also be termed as a disorder. Based on this account; do you feel that your friend is getting into trouble because of repetitive ripping off toenails? Are there any other repetitive behaviors like excessive need for cleanliness, orderliness, symmetry, any excessive religious beliefs, counting numbers, things or activities like repetitive hair pulling??

Abnormal menstrual pattern is usually observed with hormone contraception until the body adjusts to the altered hormone milieu. Also, weight gain while on the hormones increases the need for higher doses thus creating hormone imbalances and hence, menstrual disturbances. If you do not fit into either pattern, you need further evaluation. Styptics help to control the spotting. Please maintain proper nourishment and good genital hygiene. Please take the help of your health care provider for further management. Take care.",

    "answer": "Based on the provided context, I'll try to answer the question.\n\nThe context suggests that hallucinations, including hearing voices, can be symptoms of various conditions, such as psychotic disorders, obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, and organic brain disorders. \n\nRegarding cultural, psychological, and neurological factors contributing to these experiences, the context mentions that hallucinations are \"heard only by the patients having an illness and not by the others.\" This implies that there may be some neurological factors at play.\n\nThe context also mentions \"magical thinking\" in the context of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, which could be related to psychological factors.\n\nAs for the potential impacts of these experiences on an individual's perception of reality and daily life, the context mentions that hallucinations can be \"distressing\" and \"affecting individual[s],\" causing feelings of insecurity and fear.\n\nSome examples from the context include:\n\n* A 17-year-old experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations and feeling distressed and unable to sleep.\n* A person who hears voices that tell them to do things to themselves or others, causing fear and anxiety.\n* A person who experiences auditory hallucinations, including voices that are not their own, and feels like they are going to \"start screaming\" or \"jump off a building.\"\n\nThese examples illustrate how hallucinations and hearing voices can impact an individual's perception of reality and daily life.",

        "I have heard voices since I was a child, now at 50yrs old they just went away and all I get now is ocassionally I hear my name called. When I used to hear them talking I had images as well of them as imaginary people. sometimes I would feel like others could hear them. is it possible I am in remission for good?Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. They are auditory hallucinations. They are heard only by the patients having an illness and not by the others. It's still not scientifically proved, why there should be hallucinations. However, they can be treated with antipsychotics like olanzapine, risperidone or aripiprazole etc. Hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you. In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below-mentioned link:bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. ",
        "hi there i have recently started hearing a voice in my head that tells me to do things either to myself or to others and if i do not comply bad things will happen wich makes me scared to venture outside this happens all the time and i dont know what to do i have considered killing myself a few times please help thank you.Hello sterkythanks for questioners of all ask yourself whether the voices you are hearing in your head is your own voice or its coming from outside?then whether others are able to hear this voice? Or they are not understanding your problem? If these voices are vague sounds or well-formed voice?are you able to control these voices by closing your ears?are you able to sleep properly?usually hallucinations are one of important symptom in some psychotic disorders which resembles symptomatology you are describing. And they are usually distressing to affecting individual, and usually ask to do derogatory things. Second possibility in such situation is in obsessive compulsive spectrum, person is compelled to do a particular thing otherwise some bad will happen. Its more or less similar to magical thinking. Dear friend in both of the situation you should consult a good psychiatrist. And don't worry treatment is possible in both cases. Try to interact with family members and discuss with them regarding the problem. Thanks and hope you are satisfied. Take care kindly rate",
        "Im 17 years old Ive been hearing things and seeing things off and on for years...I dont know whats been going on with me just a few minutes ago Ive heard voices repeadtly call my name I dont know what to do...Its 7:10 AM i cant get any sleep Cause the voices WONT GO AWAY!!!Hi, I can understand the distress you might be facing due to hearing and visualizing things. You seem to be having visual and auditory hallucinations. It is difficult to determine the disorder with the limited information that you have given, but hallucinations are symptoms of psychotic disorders. I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist regarding your symptoms. After detailed evaluation of your condition, treatment with medications which will mostly include anti-psychotics like olanzapine, risperidone, etc., will help you in controlling your symptoms. It will also be important that you remain on regular treatment and follow up and also remain abstinent from any addictive substance (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, etc.). Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes.",
        "Hey.  Every couple months I get this voice in my head, its my own voice, but it speeds up and isnt controlled by me every couple months.  These things only happen every couple months, and only last for about 10 minutes at a time, but this voice makes me feel weird, insecure, and in my head I feel like a could jump off a building.  I just feel like I am going to actually start screaming.  Luckily I have always been able to contain this thing, but if I am in public it gets really hard to control, even though I am talking like my normal self to people, I feel like I am going to just start jumping around like a lunatic and start yelling or something haha.  What is wrong with meHi. I had gone through your query. I understand your concern. Hallucination has two types. 1. Visual 2. Auditory. Auditory hallucination specially commanding or threatened may indicate psychopathology. It can be a part of Psychosis or organic brain disorder. But it must to evaluate it about its content/duration/frequency etc. Evaluation about others associated symptoms are also necessary to reach conclusion. It can be treated with medicine like anti psychotics. Before that you have to consult psychiatrist and get help. Still if you have a query then feel free to ask. Happy to help you. Thank you."

    "question": "What are some potential causes and implications of experiencing easy bleeding, and how might this symptom present itself in various health conditions or scenarios?\nBetter give me some examples.",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, here are some potential causes and implications of experiencing easy bleeding, along with examples:\n\n1. **Bleeding Disorder**: You may have some bleeding disorder. (From context: You got a scratch on your ankle that only broke the skin in a couple of places, and a pool of blood more than 12 inches across took hours to clot.)\n\n2. **Tumor Spread in Uterus**: You may have tumor spread in the uterus or a high tendency of bleeding due to cancer. (From context: My friend has terminal cancer, and in the last 2 weeks, she has had 2 life-threatening episodes with hemorrhaging from aneurysms in the vaginal area.)\n\n3. **Severe Thrombocytopenia**: You may have severe thrombocytopenia which leads to life-threatening bleeding. (From context: My friend has terminal cancer, and in the last 2 weeks, she has had 2 life-threatening episodes with hemorrhaging from aneurysms in the vaginal area.)\n\n4. **Inadequate Hormone Support for the Luteal Phase**: Inadequate hormone support for the luteal phase, thereby causing the endometrial lining to start to slough. (From context: Hi Just want to ask coz oct.20 was my embryo transfer and yesterday oct.31 and today nov.1st im bleeding and 3days from now is my pregancy test.)\n\n5. **Starting of Period or Abnormal Pregnancy**: It could also indicate that the period is starting or that an abnormal pregnancy exists or is being miscarried. (From context: Hi Just want to ask coz oct.20 was my embryo transfer and yesterday oct.31 and today nov.1st im bleeding and 3days from now is my pregancy test.)\n\n6. **Underlying Cause of Bleeding Need to be Investigated**: The underlying cause of bleeding need to be investigated without this, it would be difficult to manage it. (From context: I have a patient suffering blood deficiency at present 3.1g; he is frequently given 1-2 bottles of blood and his counts comes to normal and after few days it again goes low as stated, so far reasons are not to know that he is spitting the blood out as it is coming out from theeth with some flesh type of thing as told by them.)",

What could be causing these symptoms?Hi, By your history and description, the possibility of bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is more likely. You are symptom-free when you go outside, and you become symptomatic when you enter the home. This is suggestive that bad odor is causing inflammation in your airways. So you need to change that carpet. Also, do a proper cleaning of that area.  Start using an air purifier, keep the windows open whenever you are in that area. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

When it rains which is often, sometimes water runs down the wall and on the floor. Anyhow, the Black mold has moved to the kitchen ceiling also. My son, Sebastian has very bad respiratory problems, he s seven years old. And I have bad breathing problems as well. I have complained to my landlord about the problem, several times. The last time he came in with a can of white paint, and painted the ceiling, and said, there you go fixed! I couldn t believe it! HELP, PLEASE, THANK YOU. Garry ByngThanks for your question I completely understand your concern Molds are various types of fungi that grow in filaments and reproduce by forming spores. Mold may grow indoors or outdoors and thrives in damp, warm, and humid environments. Molds produce irritating substances that may act as allergy-causing substances (allergens) in sensitive individuals asthma attacks may be caused by mold or mold spores in people who have asthma and are allergic to mold. Black mold can be removed by decreasing the moisture. Leaks in plumbing or other structures that lead to moisture buildup should be identified and repaired. Areas of leakage and water damage in the home should be cleaned and Chat Doctor. Use of an air conditioner or air dehumidifier during humid seasons can help reduce the potential for moisture buildup. Avoid the use of carpets in humid basements and bathrooms. Using fans and maintaining good ventilation in the home can also help prevent or control dampness. Mold inhibitor products can be added to household paints. Keep indoor humidity low (ideally between 30%-40% thanks feel free to AAK more questions may GID bless you with good health",

        "Hi I m having real severe chest and back pains went to several docs they can t find the reason I m in an old house could it be black mold my aunt died over it my 11 year old grandson has the same symptoms and this house leaks bad what are the symptoms of mold please tell me no one else can sincerely Barbara I m 59 yrs oldThanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Molds can cause variety of Pulmonary symptoms when exposed for many years. Upon inhalation, these molds can cause constant irritation, inflammatory reaction in airways. So bronchitis and asthma like diseases are common. Molds can also weaken lung defense. So chronic fungal infection can also be seen. So chronic cough, chest pain, breathlessness, wheezing etc. are the common symptoms. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x-ray 3. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out mold related Pulmonary diseases. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."

They give me a steroid injection, another Toridal I think its called injection and Vicodin and sent me home the first time.  Well I came back because I wasnt any better.  I was in severe pain.  I asked could this possibly be my kidney?  Since this was a different PA  she got to the bottom of it and did  blood work and urine test which I dont know which urine test.  She told me that I may possibly she was concerned and wanted to see me back Weds that there was a possibility of hospitalization and did not explain.  Now I have lost my health care and I admit I am not in dire pain anymore.  I do feel at this point like I have an infection in the bladder area and am miserable however, what on earth could she be concerned about as she darted out I have had this issue for a long time and assumed it was arthritis so now I am a little concerned and am upset that they have been treating me for back pain and getting no where.Hello, I empathize with your feelings. You are right that some kidney conditions like stones or urinary infection might be the cause of back pain called in medical terminology as referred pain. Such pain characteristically radiates from back to groin along with associated symptoms like burning sensation while passing urine or fever. Further evaluation includes USG, urine tests. But pain due to vertebral conditions are dull pain often radiating to hip and legs. An MRI is needed for evaluation. After a correct diagnosis on the above-mentioned lines the treatment can be started. I look forward to getting some further details of the tests already done.",
        "I have been having pain in my lower back on the right side for years.....it seems to come and go.....when the pain starts it usually lasts for a few weeks then doesn t bother me for a while....I have been to multiple emergency rooms since I was a teen and as soon as the Dr presses on that side of my back I jump because of the pain....the first thing the Dr s have said is kidneys n started ivs but when blood tests come back good they say I have just over done it......I am female 24 yrs old and have had two children and have high blood pressure anxietyDear-thanks for using Chat Doctor, I will be glad to give you my medical advice. Back pain is a very frequent problem for which we need to do a basic evaluation. You did not mention that you had had MRI of the back which gives a lot of information in terms of the vertebra, spinal stenosis and bulging disc. You might have a herniated disc pressing the nerve and giving you this pain. Kidney pain is more in the costal area or the side of the back and will improve after antibiotics. However, you need a kidney ultrasound to evaluate for kidney stone or cysts. Those can get infected and be painful. I hope that my advice has helped you. Chat Doctor. ",

I almost couldnt stand anymore. Im not peeing  blood and it does not hurt when I urinate. Im an 18 yr old female. What can it be?HelloThanks for query. Pain in kidney area could be either due to spasm of back muscle or stone in kidney. Since you do not have any other urinary symptoms or hematuria or vomiting the possibility of pain is more likely to be due to muscle spasm.However, this has t be confirmed by clinical examination by a qualified urologist and doing ultrasound scanning OG abdomen and pelvis. Taking painkillers and antibiotic should resolve the issue. Further treatment will depend upon result of these tests and final diagnosis Chat Doctor. ",

Looking to your history, It is necessary to identify the source of back pain. Don't be panic. CT scan would be ideal to rule out kidney stone and sometime associated vertebral problem. Kidney infection requires appropriate antibiotic according to urine culture report for specified duration and search for the cause for the kidney infection. Maintain adequate HY Chat Doctor.

The prevalence of schizophrenia is about one percent in the general population. If somebody has a parent who has schizophrenia the chance would be about 8 percent. If somebody has just one uncle who has schizophrenia the chance would be just slightly more than one percent.

        "Hi I am a girl age 22 , I am married from 1 year my husband s age is 33 , since we got married my husband is doing sex with a gap of 1 week or 2 sometimes 1 month, I want to ask why my husband is behaving like this? is there any psychological problem with him or what? while performing sex when he going to get discharge he suddenly pull out, i does not get satisfaction, is he weak or anxiety problem?  He also dnt want baby right now, I am really depressed, plz guide meHello, Normally couples married for one year have intercourse 2-3 times a week. But having less frequency does not point out towards any specific disorder especially when it is not associated with any problem with sexual performance (Erectile Dysfunction/ Premature Ejaculation) or other depressive/anxiety features (decreased interest in pleasurable activities/sadness of mood, hopelessness, death wishes).It's a possibility that he may be stressed out and not yet ready for kids therefore not going for intercourse. You need to talk to him and be open about your desires of sexual gratification so as you two can sort this out to resume your healthy sexual life. You may have to let him see the woman in you so as he should be attracted to you sexually more frequently. The reason for his lack of sexual desire if persists despite that may be depression, low testosterone (male sex hormone) levels, or other medical conditions such as diabetes or thyroid problem which decreases the libido. Since the reason for your depression is lack of sexual gratification by your husband, that is the treatment for you. If your depression persists, see a psychiatrist and get couple counseling. Hope the answer is helpful. Take care and feel free to ask queries. Regards.",

You don't mention that you suffer from any other related symptoms. But frequency can often be associated with urgency (a sudden need to pass urine) and difficulty in controlling the bladder to the degree that one may be incontinent. If you are troubled by these symptoms then I would recommend that you seek help from your GP or practice nurse. The bladder is emptied via the urethra by contraction of the normally relaxed detector muscle that constitutes the wall of the bladder. Lower urinary tract symptoms such as problems with frequency, urgency and getting up at night to pass urine are commonly related to an irritation bladder muscle (also known as detector instability). An unstable detector also contracts in between voiding. This causes high pressures in the bladder that may be felt as urgency and give rise to urine leakage. Rarely a deficiency of the hormone which controls the bodies water balance can result in urinary frequency and thirst. This is unlikely in your case because of the length of time you've had your symptoms, but again it is something your doctor can investigate. Thanks for using Chat Doctor forum"

        "In the past 6 months I have experienced bilateral hand pain and wrist pain. In addition, I have long term shoulder pain, jaw pain, and some knee pain. Rheumatologist said I had fibromyalgia, but i fear it is really rheumatoid arthritis. RF, CCP, ESR, LUPUS ARE NEGATIVE. slightly elevated CRP now and in the past. I feel lousy!! any thoughts? 63 yr old femaleHello, I can understand your concern. As your tests show negative for RF, ESR, CCP, Lupus, you do not have rheumatoid arthritis. I can describe you how you can differentiate between arthritis and fibromyalgia. Arthritis is a degenerative joint problem associated with the aging process. It is related with the bone pain. So if you think that the pain you have is increased while having joint movements or the joints make sounds while moving them, then you have osteoarthritis. Firbomyalgia is a disorder associated with muscles. Joints or bones are not involved in this pathology. In addition, this disorder is associated with sleep problems, excessive fatigue, and specific trigger points which will start or increase pain in the muscles. In addition, if you will stay inactive, sit in a place for a long time or after waking up from sleep, you will feel the joints are unable to move and then eventually it will improve. However, both diseases will require long term analgesics to control pain. You can visit a pain clinic or neurologist for alternate ways to manage pain. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,",

Which will start damaging the cartilage of the joint and will go for deformity over the period of time. Here the condition called as autoimmune because the immune system of the body which is supposed to fight only against the foreign body will start action (inflammation) against body cells. The classical symptom of rheumatoid arthritis is early morning stiffness for all small joints of body, specially for hand and feet. The only treatment is anti-inflammatory, and immune secretion Chat Doctor.  I also suggest my patient to follow anti-inflammatory diet like have good amount of omega 3 to have some more anti-inflammatory effect in body. For fibromyalgia again here also it's an autoimmune inflammatory condition but this affects mainly the muscles. Here the cause could be too much stress level on body, or hereditary anything. And again the treatment is exercises, anti-inflammatory ",

There are three Chat Doctor.  Pregabalin : helps to reduce anxiety and sleep disturbance.2. Cymbal ta and 3. Novella: both these are anti-depressant.  For permanent good relief I suggest my patient to improve their lifestyle have good balance diet, proper sleep and rest, keep positive attitude towards anything, and exercise regularly. Here for fibromyalgia regular exercise like stretching of pain full muscles and progressing towards strengthening the same muscles also help a lot for pain relief. But here the exercise has to be started on a gradual mode. Apart from this, regular body warm up exercise like cycling and walking also helps for fibromyalgia patient. Your next question was for treatment on rheumatoid: here understand what happens with patient who are rheumatoid positive. There will be autoimmune inflammation in body which will damage not only the harmful cells but also the normal body cells and so that patient will have complained of pain and inflammation, swelling etc. Here again the best treatment I suggest my patient is keep your self active. Do different joints and muscles mobility and flexibility exercise it will help a lot to reduce the inflammation and so that the condition will not progress. Here for both fibromyalgia as well rheumatoid also there is anti-inflammatory diet available. Talk to your dietician to have more idea on it. For detail exercise program. You can again check with your physiotherapist. And for medication do not start on your own but check with your doctor. They will suggest you best since they have seen all your report. Take care."

        "I have been having a difficult time losing weight for the past 3 years. I have Hasimotos disease. I eat well and take many different supplements. In spite of that I havemild osteoporosis, a B12 deficiency and a vitamin D deficiency even though I take 4,000 units of late. I was recently diagnosed accidentally with a high homcystine level which make me concerned that all I do is not being absorbed. Could I have a digestice enzyme deficiency and a betaine deficiency. If so, what test should I have my doctor do.Hi, One of the causes of a raised homocysteine level is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Raised homocysteine levels are also a risk factor for diseases such as heart attack (medically called myocardial infarction), stroke etc. In fact a rise in homocysteine levels detects even early phases of Vitamin B12 deficiency. As you have been diagnosed with Hashimoto disease which is an immune mediated disease you may be prone to develop immune mediated diseases in other organs as well. An immune mediated disease is one where certain molecules called autoantibodies attacks its own cells and tissues. There is a possibility that you may have a condition called PERNICIOUS ANEMIA which is known to occur in some patients with Hashimoto. Pernicious anemia is a common cause of B12 deficiency. A protein called intrinsic factor, made by parietal cells that line the stomach, is needed for B12 absorption. In pernicious anemia, inflammation damages the parietal cells, leading to little or no intrinsic factor, thus preventing the intestines from absorbing B12. I would advise you to do the following tests Intrinsic factor antibody testParietal cell antibody testify any of these tests are positive then there is the possibility that you also have PERNICIOUS ANEMIA. In addition to this please also do a Fasting blood sugar and Post radial blood sugar test to detect Diabetes mellitus which may be associated with your condition. All of the above contribute to loss of weight and a feeling of exhaustion. You should also recheck your THYROID FUNCTION TESTS (TSH, T3 and T4). I presume that you may be taking medication for Hashimoto. You should take lifelong Vitamin B12 if you have Pernicious anemia. To correct the Vitamin B12 deficiency due to Pernicious anemia one of the methods is to take 1000 mcg I'm/SC injections once daily for 7 days, then weekly for 1 month, then monthly. There is also a nasal spray option:Nasal spray: 500 mcg (1 spray in 1 nostril) weekly.",

It may have several causes such as Diabetes mellitus for which we investigate the blood sugar level. Another cause is a condition called Diabetes inspires. it's a rare condition resulting in increased thirst and urination. To detect this disease we do tests such as serum and urine sodium and serum and plasma osmolality and a special test called water deprivation test. Increased thirst may also be a subjective sensation and more so in hot humid conditions. Please get these tests done and keep yourself well HY Chat Doctor.  Best regards."

I have taken a lot of antiboitics but after 15 days UTI comea back again. Please advice me if I need to do something at my home.Thank you for the query. I would like to know your age, gender and whether you suffer from any associated comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus. I would also like to know what group of antibiotics were taken by you. As per the history, you are suffering from recurrent Urinary Tract Infection, with raised infection parameters (TLC-24000/mm3 and ESR-40). Recurrent UTI can occur due to a number of different causes in males and females. Uncontrolled Diabetes is an important cause for both genders, hence it is advisable to get your blood sugar screened (fasting and post radial blood sugar). In elderly male patients prostatomegaly is an important cause, which can lead to recurrent UTI. In elderly female subjects, bladder neck obstruction (mainly age related) can cause raised residual urinary volume, which can again lead to recurrent UTI. An ultrasonography of kidney-ureter-bladder with assessment of residual urinary volume helps in this case. Inadequate antibiotic dosage for inadequate duration is another important cause of recurrent UTI. This can lead to emergence of Chat Doctor.  A urine for routine examination and culture is needed (though in all probabilities your culture may be negative since you have received multiple courses of antibiotics). I would advise you to consult your physician since you need a thorough check-up and some specific investigations, as your infection parameters are raised (an intravenous course of high-end antibiotics may well be required after assessment). It will be slightly difficult to manage your case at home, since you are not responding to oral antibiotics. Personal hygiene is very important for prevention of UTI (keep your private areas clean and ",

My lungs still feel inflamed- family history of GERD but have no overt symptoms of acid reflux, no family history of anxiety. I was hoping to get some feedback thanks.Hi, Welcome to the forum. It is nice to know that your investigations have a normal report. The symptoms of Asthma can be controlled and discomforts reduced, but there is no clear-cut cure of the ailment. It is important for you to take care of your lifestyle, quit any kind of addition as it may trigger your symptoms. Stay stress-free and have a good sleep.  It is caused by allergy of any kind, cold, pollen, food, etc. Some have a history of asthma as a family ailment. The people who are psychologically sensitive are affected by it. Asthma is a medical condition that results due to the inflammation, swelling or narrowing of the airways (bronchioles) in the lungs. It may cause over-production of mucus sometimes. IIT results in shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing. When the episodes of asthmatic attacks (coughing, shortness of breath, wheeze) get quite occasional, steroids, bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory medications and nasal sprays have to be taken (after consultation with your treating doctor).  Asthma is not a disease. A normal, active life should be lead. Have a good day, take care.",
        "i have had chest discomfort for over a month now. It has affecting my breathing significantly. i do have asthma but it has never really affected me before. this is a constant tightness in the chest in conjunction with difficulty breathing at times. during this period i have not had a legitimate asthma attack where i am gasping for breath. before the month that i had this i sinusitis. also about a week ago i was on a course of levaquin and 40mg of predison for 5 days then a weaning dose of 20mg for 5 more days the antibiotic was for all 10 tens. to an extent it has helped and today i feel a bit better but im just curious as to what could be going on as my dr is rather vague. also there is a small chance i was exposed to black mold. thank you.Hi. I can understand your concern. Asthma is most common allergic disease which is not a curable disease but definitely controllable, by controlling the same you can lead a symptom free life. Usually presents with cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing and chest tightness. If not treated appropriately can be life-threatening. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of asthma. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)Don't worry, you will be alright.

        "Hi,I have had breathing problems for a few months now. Had an infection upper respiratory. I suffer from severe fibromyalgia and also have a hiatus hernia and stomach problems. I have asthma too but have not been too bad with it before now. I have been having pressure in my chest when lying down and have what feels like hard bone type excess on the left of my sternum. My doctor put me on a steroid inhaler as I was having bronchal spasms and loss of breath at times with alot of pain in between my shoulder blades. Due to chronic fatigue I lay down alot and havent had a cough as was congested with laying down so much. Im really scared of cancer and am at my wits end. I take antispasmodic meds also with pain relief. Im currently trying to stop smoking so have had alot of these problems in between stopping . I think the problem is my lungs and possibly something constricting my breathing like that lump at side of sternum. It is tender to touch. Upper back shoulder pain and spasms have been definitely related as its been of oing for months. Ive recently had a course of antibiotics which has helped the bronchial spams.

Its NIDAANPARIVARJAN (in Sanskrit language) which literally means avoidance of the cause. Now, in many cases people are not able to change jobs or circumstances are such that they have to remain in such conditions. Here comes the principle of PRAANVAYU (richness of oxygen and fresh air) that is achieved by rhythms of deep breathing exercises called PRAANAYAM. Indias Yoga has spread to the World and people who are aware are enjoying the benefits. It enhances immunity, gives strength to fight allergens and extends life as also betters quality of life. Then there are herbs to naturally support the fight of body against allergens. Simple herbs like Turmeric, Need, Manisha, Gilroy, Quasi (Holy basil) etc. not only counter allergens but detoxifies the blood and also raise natural immunity.

Regards, NSHi, Evion, Colin, B complex and Maxima tablets, daily one can be taken. Being vitamin supplements, they do not cause any adverse effects. Raw eggs all have the same benefits as cooked eggs. However, protein absorption is lower from raw eggs, and the uptake of biotin may be prevented. Most concerning is the small risk of raw eggs contaminated with bacteria leading to Salmonella infection. Buying pasteurized eggs will lower your risk of infection. Raw or cooked eggs can be consumed. In case of more than 3 eggs, boiled egg white can be consumed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

Milk allergy is may be due to milk protein intolerance or lactose intolerance. Individuals who are allergic to eggs, react to the proteins in egg whites. Every time the person eats an egg, the body thinks these proteins are harmful invaders. For both the allergen immune system responds by releasing histamine which causes an allergic reaction.

Plz reply as soon as possible..Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and here are the answers. Firstly, any unprotected intercourse during the safe period does not cause conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period in the cycle. So, if you happened to have the intercourse during the safe period, you are naturally protected. The intake of the emergency pill occurred during the stipulated time after the intercourse, so the protection offered is in the range of 98%. The pill can cause side effects like nausea, headaches, vomiting, breast tenderness and with Chat Doctor.  The next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year and get further help if you become overdue by ten days for your next period. Hope this helps."

In between these periods I have felt extremely happy and excited about the future. It is probably also worth mentioning that just before I had the implant fitted my youngest son was diagnosed with autism and my husband lost his job this caused a huge amount of stress and could be the cause for my depression. I know my Grandma suffered with depression at the end of her life and my Mum has periods of it. I also suffered from depression as a child (from about age 10 to 15) and then I had post natal depression after my first child. Could the implant be the cause or could I be bi polar? I have read a lot about the condition and seem to tick a lot of boxes.Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query.

I am doing a biology research in school about monoclonal antibodies, and I was hoping you can help me in it if you can. my questions are : How monoclonal antibodies can help in cancer therapy? and how does this therapy work? Since when this therapy had been used and how many people improved or were cured because of it? Thank youHi Reyna. All cells in the body have many receptors present on the surface and inside the cell. These are necessary for their normal functioning. Cancer cells utilize some of these receptors to enhance their growth and stay immortal. So we as oncologists have started to use these receptors for treating cancer by blocking these receptors. That is done by using monoclonal antibodies and is called targeted therapy. It was started in the 90s with a Chat Doctor.  Now there is a plethora of such ",

Sorry to hear about your father and hope your mum has won her battle against cancer. Some cancers run in the families and some evolve by themselves. There are genes which are markers for certain cancers but every one having the marker might not get the disease. Immunoglobulins are certain proteins that are part of the immune mechanism. Medical literature says that there is a traditional view that immunoglobulins produced only by differentiated B lymphocytes has been challenged as immunoglobulin genes have been found to be expressed in hematopoietic human cancer cells. However, this phenomenon has not been widely accepted, and knowledge about this newly discovered concept is limited.Therefore, a lot of research on individual immunoglobulins is going on and there is a lot of knowledge still to be discovered in this area.

Also little overweight.But do regular exercise pretty much 5 days a week.Also, sometimes I feel my heart palpatation is high. Please let me know what can I do.Good day! The most common answer to the symptoms you are experiencing is Carpal Tunnel. It is compression of a main nerve in your hand that comes from repeated movement and compression of the wrist. The symptoms can often occur at night due to accumulated tension throughout the day. As for the palpation, how high is your heart-rate? Common causes can be coffee, deny Chat Doctor.  If you experience any other symptoms certainly see a physician for a Cardiac Check-up. As for the wrist, try taking breaks from repetitive tasks involving your hands. There are wrist splints that can be bought over the counter, they are very useful. Stretching exercises may also help: make a fist and then spread your fingers out. I hope this advice can be helpful, and leads you in the correct direction. You have my warm regards.",

A friend of mine who has also recently revealed that she has experienced Cellulius as well and has been treated with Ichthammoll ointment and hot and cold revulsion compression therapy to be healed. Can you tell me more about this later option...the Ichthammol ointment with the revulsion compression?Hi, Cold compression therapy is usually used to reduce pain, inflammation or after surgery. It works on the principal of rest & ice, compression & elevation to reduce pain. It reduces the temperature of the tissues thus reducing the metabolic rate.  Cold therapy is a combination of cryotherapy & static compression. Tissue at lower temperature reduces pain, inflammation & protects tissues from damage. Adjustable elastic wraps & other wraps are available in protective layers so that ice is not directly applied.  Application of hot & cold compression results in increased blood circulation & hence good health. Too much cold compression can lead to frostbite, so get connected with the PCP or physiotherapist.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

I read carefully your question and understand your concern. I would like to know your age and if you have a family history for tremor. There are different causes of tremor. As far as I understand from your description, yours is an intentional tremor, which gets worse when you try to reach for the target. In a young patient I would think about a metabolic cause like hyperthyroidism. While in older patients I would think about essential tremor, a degenerative disease or a stroke. But the gradual beginning of your tremor rules out a possible stroke. A positive family history for tremor would be in favor of essential tremor diagnosis. Sleep apnea can cause tremor in the hands during the day, but it would improve with the good treatment of apnea. So I would recommend you to consult with the neurologist and have a full blood work and the thyroid function tests. A brain MRI may be helpful if the above tests result normal.

        "recently almost every day,usually later in the day,my voice becomes very hoarse and scratchy.Im not sure why this is happening.I have not had a change of address or any colds or problems with ventilation in my home.A friend of mine was concerened ,they had cancer discovered when a Dr. noticed his voice was so ruff and hoarseHi, I am Chat Doctor.  The likelihood of your voice hoarseness being of cancerous origin is likely if you smoke, take lots of alcoholic spirits, have a family history of throat cancer, strain a lot with your voice or do oral sex (some strains of HPV virus which can be contracted from oral sex) can cause throat cancer. Otherwise, if you use your voice a lot (at work or somewhere else) especially lately, then you can have voice hoarseness without it being a cancer. Another cause may be the onset of a palsy of the nerve that innervates the voice box. It could also be onset of symptoms of a voice box muscle involvement of a myasthenia graves (or some other related muscle weakness disorder) which often worsens with time of the day. Please see a physician for thorough examination and proper work-up in order to determine the cause. Courage and wish you the best, ",
        "I have had a hoarse voice for 3 months and a pain in my mid to upper back (feels like my lung) for almost the same length of time. The pain is now unbearable in my back and the last few days have experienced pains running down the tops of my arms. I am also starting to get the same lung pain on the left.Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Hoarseness of voice with chest pain can be seen in many conditions, but the common causes are1. Lung malignancy2. Endobronchial tuberculosis3. Lung abscess4. Phoenix nerve palsy with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (vocal cord paralysis)So better to consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. CT thorax3. Bronchoscopic evaluation of vocal cords and trachea to rule out above-mentioned causes. Examination of vocal cords is very important in hoarseness of voice. Its movement, nodules on surface, ulcers etc. can be very informative to reach the diagnosis. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.",
        "I had an acoustic neuroma removed Feb 2015. in the last 2-months I have constant hoarseness in my voice. I also have had increased difficulty with swallowing and have omitted certain foods. About the same time i started having hoarseness, i was having problems with vomiting. My PCP Rx Bentyl and it has helped.I return to Mayo in Rochester in a couple of weeks. Any suggestionsHi, I understand your concern. Hoarseness in your voice could be due to an acute irritation of the larynx and trachea and vocal cords. It could be due to acute viral infection, or irritation of acidic liquid of stomach when you had the episodes of vomiting. It is better to get checked by ENT specialist to determine the right diagnosis. Keep good oral and throat hygiene. Gargle with warm water and salt. Take antihistamine orally until you see ENT specialist. Wish fast recovery.",
        "I have had a hoarse voice for a week and recently started coughing up a yellow thick mucus.  I went to a clinic yesterday and they did a rapid streptest  and said it was positive.  I have been on penicillin and clarithromycin for about 32 hours now but still no improvement in my voice.Dear Friend. Hi, I am Chat Doctor, I have read your query in detail, I understand your concern. This can occur due to severe Laryngitis. Best treatment for this is Steam Inhalation and Warm Saline Gargles. Do them. Also, if you have only the problem oh hoarseness of Voice, also get your Thyroid Function tests. Review with reports. This is my personal opinion based on details available here.  If you still have any query you may please ask me. Stay Healthy. Chat Doctor, MD"

        "I am 28 weeks pregnant and have just been to doctor and my blood pressure was 150/90 and there was protein in my urine. They have taken blood and are ringin me back at 5pm with the results.  The doctor said I may have pre-eclampsia which would mean early labour.  I have got home and am now very anxious.  Would early labour mean now? Or jsut bed restHI, Thanks for the query under Chat Doctor.  I have read & understood your concern.  * Preeclampsia is a critical condition in pregnancy, which is liable to turn in Clamps which has risk for mother as well as baby. So once pre-eclampsia is noted, doctor tries his best to control the situation & avoid further complication.  But in case there is no response to palliative treatment. Delivery of the baby remains the only sure treatment to control blood pressure & avoid complications. Of course the decision induction/ LSCS is taken with balancing the fetal viability & possible risk.  * Apart from this pre-eclampsia itself can cause premature deliver .on its own.  ** So the possibility of early delivery can be guessed by the known course of the condition itself , & one has to be prepared to accept it, and try to control the symptoms & prolong delivery as far as possible.  Still, no control of blood pressure / albumin inspire of treatment ascertains early delivery.  Thanks.",
        "dear sir,my wife is 29+week pregnant now and has 3+ protein in urine,and she is suffering from pre eclampsia, B.P is fluctuating in a day as low as 120/90 and as high as 160/120,LDH,Uric acid,Platelets in serum are in normal range. using Methyl dopa 500mg Nifedipine Retard 20mg thrice a day and labetalol 100mg twice a day.but blood presuure is getting controlled,one day cardiologist suggested a diuretic 20 mg as a stat dose,immediately then b.p has controlled for about 2 days,we stopped taking it,again B.P is shooting up,i am very much worried about mother s point of vie first and then about baby.is it safe using diuretic in pregnancy?if not what can be done to control Blood Pressure?Hi there ,Preeclampsia, especially severe pre-eclampsia like the one seen in your wife can be a very difficult situation to be in. At 29 weeks It's still too early and the care of mother and baby are very important. The best treatment for pre-eclampsia is delivery, but at 29 week the babies' survival is a concern. We need to monitor the mothers health and the fetal condition in way of hourly BP monitoring, blood test, urine test, Fetal ultrasound and fetal Doppler and Fetal heart tracings in the form of NST. Diuretics have to be used very cautiously in pregnancy, and are avoided unless no alternative is available. If the maternal or fetal condition deteriorates at any point, it's best to consider deliver, in a hospital with good NICU back up. Hope this helps. Regards.",
        "Im 33 weeks pregnant and had a sudden spike in my blood pressure. It went to 170/110 but slowly went down throughout the day. Was feeling horrible (headache, anxious, very hot and flushed) during the spike and all symptoms except the headache have went away. All bloodwork came back normal except my liver function panel was a bit off. Awaiting 24 hr protein test results and am on bedrest until all tests come back. My BP s have stayed normal (110/78 range) since the spike. Is it possible to have preeclampsia with normal BP s, or is it possible to have random spikes that high and nothing be wrong?Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion there is no chance of preeclampsia with normal BP. Infact preeclampsia is a combination of high BP more than or equal to 140/90 along with proteinuria and with or without pathological swelling of feet. But at the same time presence of spikes of high BP might also cannot be considered as normal. Mild elevations up to 130/80 might be acceptable but not more than that. The BP should be recorded at 6 hours apart. If at both the instances the BP is high pregnancy induced hypertension(PIN) is said to be present. The presence of abnormal liver parameters, headache,high spikes of BP might suggest PIN .24 hour protein is helpful to diagnose if it is just PIN or preeclampsia. Avoid stress and relax. As there are medicines available which can control BP. Check your fetal movements and other symptoms of clamps like vomiting, epigastric pain, blurred vision, decreased urine output. These are called imminent signs of clamps. Eclampsia is a condition where preeclampsia is superimposed by fits. Take high protein diet and relax. You might not go up to that clamps level but just I am giving you the information. Hope this helps. Best regards.",
        "Hello, my best friend is pregnant and on bedrest in the hospital for toxemia and extremely high blood pressure. It was last recorded at 189/109. My question is how high can it get before it gets really dangerous for her or the baby? I don t understand why she has hasn t been induced yet.Hi there, Toxemia of pregnancy or severe pre-eclampsia is a very worrisome condition and the blood pressure you have mentioned are very high. The life of your friend is at risk at such high pressure, and she can get a convulsion/fit, bleeding, kidney failure at any time. She needs to be taken care in an Intensive Care unit and monitoring of the condition and medication to control the blood pressure should be given. She will also require an injection Magnesium Sulfate intravenous Chat Doctor. Yes delivery will definitely improve her situation as the cause of high pressure is the pregnancy. But whether induction of labor or cesarean section will have to be decided based on her previous delivery, her general condition and the likelihood of successful vaginal delivery if induced. It would help me to guide you better if you would tell me how many weeks pregnant she is currently. Hope this helps. Regards."

        "I just completed 6 weeks of physical therapy for a diagnosis of achilles tendon. They worked on reposturing my weight from the balls of my feet to my heels, stretching the tendons with exercises and graston tool. Although I have gained more range of motion in the ankle I continue to have my main symptom of heel pain, especially after sleeping and sitting for more than 30 minutes. They have suggested I see a podiatrist for other options. I still have questions about if this has been helpful treatment, if I should be using orthotics or specific show types, if my S--- sock helps in bed or need a boot, if a podiatrist can help. I have been suffering for 5 months.Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. As you have Achilles tendon and with Physical Therapy you are helped it is good that you continue further. As your ROM has improved and also the strength now needs a bit of correction of the proprioception. Using a balance board training will help further more and also walking on a ground with bare feet. In my clinical practice only physical therapy, balance board training, bare feet walking on ground, grass, standing on the acupressure plate etc. helps patients regain the normalcy of life.

Wear a good ankle and lower leg brace that will keep the Achilles tendon immobilized, and prevent a limp. Also do lower leg calf muscle strengthening exercises every day. It may take 5-6 years to show improvement, but be patient. When at home use an ankle strap (you will get these in a good sports shop). These are the only things that will help but will take time.

When a person gets infected, he is said to be HIV +ve, but when the symptoms of the disease appear in the body (which could be anywhere from 5-10 years), he is said to be suffering from AIDS.\n\n2. In the initial stage, when he is HIV +ve, the CD4 count is sufficient, and the immune system is strong. Apart from medical management, Ramayana (Immunomodulators) can be used.\n\n3. In a full-blown case of AIDS, since the CD4 count becomes low, and the immune system becomes weak, the person is prone to Opportunistic Infections. Treatment should be started without delay with ART (anti-retro viral) Therapy along with Symptomatic Treatment from Alternate systems of Medicine.\n\nThis distinction is crucial in understanding the progression of the disease. For example, a person who is HIV +ve but does not have symptoms may not require immediate treatment, but if they develop symptoms and are diagnosed with AIDS, they require immediate treatment with ART and Symptomatic Treatment.\n\nIn the context of the provided questions, the distinction between HIV and AIDS is also relevant. For instance, a person who has been experiencing symptoms similar to those of HIV (swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and sweating) after unprotected sex may not necessarily have HIV, as these symptoms can also be caused by other viral or bacterial infections. However, it is essential to get tested for HIV, especially after a high-risk exposure, to determine if the person is infected.",

However, within 12 hours, she experiences a heart rate increase, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, and is told that if the distance between systolic and diastolic pressure gets less than 20 points, she needs to call for help.\n\nAccording to the context, the reason for this risk is that the woman might be having heart failure. In heart failure, the systolic pressure decreases fast, then the diastolic pressure, due to the poor force of contraction by the failing heart. This causes the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures to come down to less than 20. \n\nThe context also mentions that the doctor's initial assumption that the steroid would increase the patient's blood pressure is not true for all patients, especially in cases of heart failure.\n\nRegarding the steroid shot for your son, the context explains that steroids can cause side effects such as peptic ulcer, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, sore throat, and oro-pharyngeal candidiasis.\n\nLastly, regarding your wife's situation, the context suggests that increasing her prednisolone dose might not be helpful, especially since she has osteoporosis and adrenal fatigue.",

I am Chat Doctor Psychiatry from India. I can understand your concern. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your query. I have carefully read your question and could understand that you are suffering from osteoarthritis and neuropathic pain. Firstly let me educate you about various available medicines for pain. Pain is a noxious stimulus which should be managed promptly. Nowadays pain management is done through a multidisciplinary approach which includes physician, surgeon, anesthetist and psychiatrist. If pain is recurring and simple painkillers like NSAIDs are ineffective then some alternatives should be tried. There are few medicines which act locally like pain relief gels and sprays. Some newer oral medicines act at spinal cord and brain level and reduce the perception of pain. Some medicines contain combination of an analgesic and an opioid. Some refractory cases required nerve block. Now coming to your case, since you are having chronic pain of osteoarthritis and neuropathy, you need regular medicine. Common painkiller NSAIDs may be dangerous as they may cause peptic ulcer and renal complications. Opioid medication may be addicting. Hence, you need something with little side effect. If a lady like you comes to my clinic, I suggest them to relax and try some De-stressing measures. Because stress and anxiety increases the perception of pain. These distressing activities are:-- healthy balance diet-regular exercise, yoga, meditation & relaxation exercise-adequate rest and sleep-listening soothing slow relaxing music etc. If needed I prescribe them some medicines like Pregabalin and Nortriptyline in combination along with methylcobalamin and folic acid. These medicines act on spinal cord and brain pain pathways and are relatively safer for long term use. Results in clinical settings are rewarding. You may discuss these issues with your doctor. Hope I have given you a way. I wish you all the best.",

These four things will help you I believe in your life to fight against the pain better way then just taking a painkiller.  Apart from this for localize pain you can also use hot and cold pack to have some more relaxing and anti-inflammatory effects. In your diet remember to keep more of omega 3 because it's a natural anti-inflammatory and helps for many other problems in our body. Hope this was useful for you. Ask your question again if needed. Take care.",
            "Hello, 33 female I weigh 145 and am told i have good blood pressure. I have four children. Constant daily head pain above right temple for 4 years. Thought was tooth infection or chronic sinusitis, but had tooth pulled a year ago with only worsening of pain since then. No stuffy nose ever. But last 6 months chest pain and left middle to lower stomach pain have added to my daily list. Doctors have done MRIs ,Cat scans, and told me also to pick a symptom.Hi, I cannot say in your particular case, but generally, pains in vastly different parts of the body are not going to have the same physiology. The location and movement of a pain gives clues as to what is going on. Also, if pain were from an organ dysfunction, generally there are other signs. Psychological underpinnings of pain can be tricky and people do not want to miss an organ malfunctioning. On, the other hand, if organ malfunctioning does not seem to be occurring--and this should be monitored periodically--then coping skills for pain would overlap completely with psychological causes. One does not have to know the cause of pain to work on it. CBT and antidepressants with pain efficacy (amitriptyline) are one option. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

It is important to talk to your doctor regarding addition of a good oral antibiotic to control any infection that might have started at the surgery site. Surgery has been done properly, and the cancer is removed. However, there can always be a focus of infection that has started after surgery and this can be due to many causes including multiplication of bacteria which has entered through the stitches. As polypoid is causing reaction, you must immediately add another oral antibiotic which is recommended by your doctor. This will stabilize the bacterial infection and reduce the soreness.

I appreciate your concern regarding this matter and I'll try to help where I can. If one sustains a superficial scratch on the skin, then you should look out for signs of infection at around the third day after the injury. These signs include redness around the site of the wound, pus discharging from the wound itself or generalized fever experienced by the patient. If you start to notice these signs, then I would suggest that you see your doctor as soon as you can so that they may prescribe the appropriate treatment for this issue. In order to prevent an infection from occurring you can continue with the following care. You can clean the wound with a saline solution (salt water) 3 times a day until the wound has made a scab over it. You can then let the area granulate on its own. I hope this helps and good luck."

            "My papillae are extremely swollen right now. I ve also got a sore throat and congestion (when I woke up this morning, my lymph nodes were horribly swollen). I had a fever for part of the night, I believe, but seem to be normal temperature now.

Several factors, like inflammatory diseases, adverse Chat Doctor. First, a careful physical exam is necessary to rule in/out possible signs of infection, or alternative disorders.

After all that time I was finally diagnosed with bipolar diorder, great right, maybe I ll get some help and feel better... Well nothing s helping, I m tired & scared. There s no where else to turn here:(Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I can understand your feelings and emotions. But you should realize the reality with the mental disorder concept. The more you worry about your mental disorder (whatever it is) the more it will trouble you. I also understand, how troublesome the problem is. But, there is no alternative to manage it. You were consulting a psychiatrist for 12 years and just last year you were diagnosed bipolar. That seems to be peculiar. But naming a mental disorder is just for prescribing medicines. Psychologists and therapists approach the mental disorder in a different angle, and they provide you with psychotherapy methods to manage your disorder. Awareness is the first step to manage your disorder. You should be aware of your symptoms, frequency, type, how it disturbs you, whole pattern of the symptoms etc. once you how and when the symptoms come, you can easily put diversions. Therefore, as the first step of therapy process, I suggest you to maintain a diary about everything from your thoughts and emotions and behaviors and symptoms. Be systematic. Continue writing this cognitive diary for a month and then with the diary visit a psychologist and rest of the therapy will be provided by the therapist. Don't worry. Management will be as effective as cure. Smile now. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute detail possible.

Is this ok? I also lost 15 pounds and am now 105 pounds. Oh, and Im 50yrs. old.Hello, Few strategies to reduce the stress and I hope once you follow these things you will ace to overcome stress1. Diet: Ensure intake of an adequate quantity of fiber. 2. Servings of vegetable salad and two servings of fruits (One preferable citrus fruit). A proper diet does miracles and rejuvenates. Orange is a good source of anti-oxidants. Avoid junk food and fast food especially pizza, burgers and excessive sweets.2. Ensure adequate water intake: Follow the rule of one which I usually advise. One glass of water one hour before and one glass of water one hour after every meal will ensure adequate consumption of water. The recommended intake of water is two to three-liter in a day.3. Early morning Exercise: Brisk walking for 30 minutes at a stretch preferably in the garden will be very helpful. Walking is the best exercise, it also promotes the release of endorphins (naturally occurring painkillers released in the brain) which causes mood elevation and a generalized feeling of well-being.4. Avoid tea or coffee or nicotine and alcoholic beverages5. Start your day with a glass of lemon water with two spoons of honey added.6. Don't take work so seriously: We all have the feeling to excel in our respective fields and don't spend adequate time with our self trying to understand our own needs. Spend time with your family and friends.7. While working takes frequent regular breaks: Taking regular breaks will not waste the time, but it will increase productivity, concentration, and reasoning.8. Avoid late-night socialization9. Avoid starring for a longer time at the computer screen or TV for a longer time10. Steam inhalation before going to sleep will be very refreshing.11. Multivitamin and calcium supplement.

It can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) and enlargement of the spleen and in your case due to poor appetite the child has lost weight, which he is likely to regain once he starts recuperating.

Most cases of mononucleosis, mono, are caused by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (ABV) and get it only once. Sometimes mononucleosis symptoms may recur months or even years later. Once you're infected with ABV, you carry the virus for the rest of your life. The virus may reactivate off and on.  The virus can then be detected in the saliva, but one does not usually become ill. In mono one often has a general feeling of malaise, starting with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, headache and sore throat.

Will this self resolve or do you think she needs IV fluids? I dont think the doctor checked her blood, I think it was that fast test.Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Infectious mononucleosis is also called as \"kissing disease\" and glandular fever which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (ABV). Infectious mononucleosis is a contagious illness and the infection can be spread by saliva and the incubation period is four to eight weeks. This can be diagnosed by blood tests.

            "Hi Doctor, My daughter is 3.5 Years old. She is complaining stomach ache some times. We have given Rantac and Bifilac sachet for 5 days. After stopping the medication, she is complaining stomach ache again. Please suggest. regards, NarendraWelcome to the Chat Doctor I completely understand your concerns but don't worry. If the stomach pain is central and not associated with any other symptoms such as fever, jaundice, vomiting, bowel or bladder dysfunction, then it is not likely to be benign. Toddlers are prone to abdominal pains especially due to gut infestation by parasites. I usually recommend to deform the child with Single dose of Albendazole and repeat dose after 15 days. Along with this give healthy diet with lots of fluids especially water. Avoid spicy and oily food for the time being including fast foods. Hopefully this will help. In case the pain is associated with any of the above-mentioned symptoms, then a proper clinical examination by pediatrician will help. For any further questions, you may contact me. Take care",

Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. It is imperative to undergo multiple tests in case of pain in abdomen of a child of 7 years as she may give a proper and detailed history.

The causes of pain in abdomen in a child are as follows:The most probable cause of pain in a child -Tummy tonsils-meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms. The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. Some blood, urine and stool tests.

U should see a pediatrician who will examine your children abdomen and can tell u if he needs any investigations or not. The other two symptoms does look related to stomach pain.

They are saying it is a stomach virus, but he is hurting in his legs, chest and bilateral lower stomach. he is running a temp of 103. he is yelling out when pain starts until morphine kicks in.Hi. Thanks for your query. The commonest causes for severe pain in abdomen in a child of 8 years old are to be ruled out by investigations:Blood-CBC, Tidal, Urine -routine, microscopy, culture and sensitivity.Stool-Routine and microscopy, Culture and sensitivity if loose stools. Ultrasonography of the abdomen. A consultation with the Pediatric Surgeon is a must as it helps for better diagnosis. A course of an antibiotic and metronidazole with intravenous fluids should help, and the further treatment will depend upon the findings of the reports and a definite treatment can be carried out. Appendicitis, lymph node mass, pyelonephritis are a few common causes. Stomach flu is said to be a reason only if all the investigations are normal and an occasional cause like abdominal epilepsy has to be borne in mind. Morphine should be avoided as much as possible. If the child is needing Morphine there is more than the stomach flu."

It may require 2 to 3 stool analysis done regularly to look for the tapeworm infestation. 2. Blood test to detect antibodies your body may have produced to fight tapeworm infection. 3.

That same night I had unprotected sex and I looked at the symptoms for HIV and they are exactly like mine. But most of the sites say that symptoms usually take 2-4 weeks. Could this be a coincidence or are they symptoms of HIV?Hello! I have been through your question. You should know that many people with HIV have no symptoms for several years, others may develop symptoms similar to flu, usually two to six weeks after catching the HIV. Related your concern, and based on your data, having unprotected sex few days ago, the good news for the moment is that I think is more possible to have these symptoms for other reasons (viral or bacterial), and not the primary HIV infection, even they are similar.

The exact nature of the rash varies based on the type of the tick. Some types of patterns seen are target-shaped lesions, bumpy rash, vacuoles. However, when one uses a steroid or lotion, the type of rash may change because the symptoms have reduced as the histamine that causes rash would not produce a full-fledged rash. It is possible for the rash to be a tick fever or tick-related disease, but this cannot be confirmed without tests.

What are the long term untreated symptoms of Lyme disease and how would it be detected and treated. Can you shed some advice that would help me after all these years?Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Lymes disease is caused by a spirochete called Cordelia burgdoferi which usually is spread by tick bites. The typical presentation would be a rash at the site of bite. This is the first stage. The second stage presents with fever and body pain, headaches, joint pains and lymph node swelling. This occurs after few weeks after first stage. The third stage is stage of persistent infection where there are symptoms of arthritis, dermatitis and neuropathy. Clinical diagnosis is missed as it is a slow disease. Lab diagnosis is by serological tests like ELISA and Immunofluorescence for Egg antibodies. Rising title indicates active infection. Treatment is by Doxycycline, Amoxicillin, Cefuroxime. Hope I have cleared your doubts. Thanks.",
            "About a month ago, I found a small tick lodged on my thigh. I carefully extracted it with tweezers and successfully got the head out. Today, I felt a bump on my thigh and squeezed it before I realized it was the spot where I was bitten a month ago. I do not have the bulls eye rash or any other symptoms I have read about for Lyme except that off and on recently random joints hurt for a day then feel fine. Should I get checked for Lyme disease?Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Lymes disease when progresses to chronic stage it usually presents with joint pain, lethargy, generalized weakness, dermatitis and can be depressing to some extent. Try to divert your mind from your symptoms by keeping in touch with friends and family and keeping yourself busy throughout the day. Lyme disease has early signs and symptoms and later signs and symptoms. The early once appear within a month and include rash on the place where you have been bitten and flu like symptoms. So if you've been bitten and experience signs and symptoms of Lyme disease, contact your doctor immediately. Treatment for Lyme disease is most effective if begun early. However, diagnosis can be confirmed by ELISA for Egg against Cordelia and can be confirmed by a western blot test. Thank you.",
            "I was bitten by a tick while in Germany about 2 months ago. Since then, I have been experiencing extreme fatigue and have had many headaches and a lot of stiffness of the muscles and joints, especially in my back. I did not get any kind of rash where the tick was, but do you think it could possible be Lyme Disease?Dear I can understand your concern. I would like to inform you that yes Lyme disease can cause all these symptoms such as extreme fatigue, headache, stiffness of neck, joint and muscle pain. So in my opinion you discuss about this with your physician as soon as possible because at an early stage it can né managed very easily with antibiotics. If left untreated this may cause more troubles such as may affect heart and nerves also. Hope this will help you dear.  If you have any other concerns please feel free to message me.

            "Hello, I have been sick for years and I was finally diagnosed with Lymes disease, BVVP, and panic disorder. I always feel swimmy headed, my head feels full, dull feeling and I had CT scan then MRI which showed changes but that was after the lymes was diagnosed, then I had several different virus that came back + like slapping baby syndrome I am 50. Any ideas???Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Lyme disease is a bacterial disease which is transmitted to humans by the bite of ticks carrying a bacterium known as Cordelia burgdorferi. The initial infection can occur with minimal or no symptoms. But many people experience a flu like illness and a characteristic rash several days to a few weeks following a tick bite. The rash is a red rash that grows in size daily. It is called erythema migrant. Rash is a skin lesion that typically begins as a red spot and expands over a period of days to weeks to form a large round lesion of at least 5 cm. Its shape can be circular or oval. It can be confirmed by performing blood tests to examine for antibodies to the bacteria. Thank you"

Are any of your patients males suffering from disorders such as Anorexia nervosa, Bulimia nervosa, etc.?

Today I woke up with congestion (even though I can breathe through my nose) and Im very tired.  Is this allergies or a cold brewing?  Been taking zinc just in caseHello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions for you:1. If you have these symptoms occasionally only, I would suggest you not to worry about allergy (maybe an infection or an irritating reaction to something like smoke, strong smell, fumes, or any other irritant) or even they are seasonal, you may have seasonal allergies only.2. If you have such symptoms often or repeatedly, you may have allergic causes. In that case, I would suggest you an allergy evaluation by an Allergist.3. At present, I would suggest you an antihistamine like levocetirizine or fexofenadine and a decongestant nasal spray like oxymetazoline for 2-3 days.4. Plenty of warm fluids during the days as well as adequate rest will also help you.5. Usually zinc does not cause such symptoms, so I would suggest you not to worry about zinc.

Thanks for choosing us for your health query. Your father recovering from minor stroke. But if you had mentioned the co morbid conditions it should have helped us to guide you more accurately. Any way with an assumption that he has diabetes, hypertension and stroke I will guide for a healthy diet and lifestyle. You need to calculate the calories in your father food limit his calorie intake to 1800 because is a sedentary male. Of the calories you need to give 800 calories in morning and 500 for noon and night. If his kidneys are fine we need not restrict on the protein give 1gm/ kg body weight. Control his oil intake to 4 teaspoons per day because he had stroke high lipids are basic cause. Take care of hidden fat also that present in groundnut, coconut etc. If kidneys are fine we do not need to cut his veggie intake. If he is a diabetic and is under control you can give two portions of cut fruits 100gm each. Hope our suggestion helps. Take care",

HDL is a good cholesterol.  It is protective in heart disease. Low HDL is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. You should take low fat diet with high amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Repeat your cholesterol level after a month.

In general I would say that the improvement since TURP is only marginal. ThanksHelloThanks for query. You have difficulty in passing urine and frequency for urination even after three months of TURN surgery for enlarged prostate. This could be either narrowing of urethral passage (Stricture Urethra) which is common after TURN or second possibility of persistent UTI. Please get your routine Urine test and urine culture done to rule out infection. Visit your Urologist and discuss with him regarding doing endoscopic examination of urethra and bladder (Cystoscopy) . If needed he may do endoscopic dilatation of urethral passage (VIA)during the same sitting. This will resolve your problem. Chat Doctor. ",

Hypertrophied turbinates are the common cause for blocked nose in child Chat Doctor.  They actually cause mechanical obstruction. And hence surgery is must overcome this mechanical obstruction. Laser surgeries are better than radio surgeries. Laser surgeries are safer, and they give faster recovery time. So in hospital stay is less, and hence cost is also reduced.

            "Hi I m sixty two year old woman,last six years I v had suffering with cold sore virus outbreak after outbreak which has made me quite I ll, in between had shingles,in begging tired ACYCLOVIR which did nt really help with coldsore viruse.i ve recently been diagnosed with Fybromiaga which I m sure cold sore virus is makeing much worse, also suffer from insterstitial cystitic ,would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks Mary.HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Cold sores are caused by the herpes virus which is related to the chicken pox virus that causes shingles. Cold sores are not normally associated with systemic symptoms, in most cases the symptoms are limited to the area where the sores are located though this can vary from one person to the next. Cold sores tend to re-occur when the immune system is impaired so using multivitamins and a wide range of fruits and vegetables (so can get a range of minerals and vitamins) may help to boost your immunity. In addition, the use of probiotics may help. Probiotics also help to boost immunity. I hope this helps",

It has been 3 months now and I seem to get cold sore more frequently.  Anything I can do?  Will this subsdie after being on microgestin longer?Hi, Thanks for posting the query, Cold sores occur due to trauma physical or chemical, I would suggest you to plan for some other methods of contraception by discussing with your ORGAN. Apply Hegel oral ointment topically over the affected area, take lukewarm saline and antiseptic mouthwash rinses. Take multivitamin supplements, antioxidants, take plenty of fluids which are rich in vitamin C like lemons, oranges. Maintain a very good oral hygiene. Hope you find this as helpful, Take care!",
            "I have a history of cold sores, and am currently dealing with an outbreak.  I have been using Abreva, but I believe there is an infection because my lip and glands under my chin are extremely swollen.  The sore is not healing as quickly as it should be.  This has happened in the past and my doctor prescribed an antibiotic to help with the infection so it didnt spread.  What antibiotic will help with this that I could call into my doctor for?Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint cold sores are caused by viral infection, and it is a HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 1. The virus can remain dormant within the nerves and can get re-activated at any point of time and can cause an outburst. The severity of the symptoms depend upon the severity with which the infection has occurred, and it is not always necessary to have mild or severe symptoms and can vary at every outburst and in cases when there is some reduced immunity of the body the infection can occur with higher severity. As the antibiotics acts only against bacteria so taking an antibiotic for viral infection can no way cure the infection. Swollen lip and submental lymphadenopathy or swelling can be due to infection outbreak only. I would suggest you to consult an Infectious disease specialist or a dermatologist and get evaluated. You will be prescribed with oral anti viral like Acyclovir and Acyclovir for preventing further outbursts. Although the antivirals do not cure the current infection, but it prevents the further outbreaks of the infection. Applying Rivera which is a topical antiviral ointment can help and should be continued. Avoid making intimate contact wit other individuals as it can cause them infection as well as use personal things like towels, utensils etc. without sharing with others to prevent transmission of infection as it is a communicable disease. Hope this information helps. If you find the answer helpful kindly write a positive review and click on found this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. ",
            "I was kissed on the cheek by someone with a cold sore.  The person with the cold sore says that it is dried up, but it is still clearly visible, and my assumption is that it is still possibly contagious.  I washed my face and applied rubbing alcohol 8 hours later.  Have I received the virus? Also, if I touch my cheek and then touch another part of my face will I get a cold sore?Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint in case if someone has a cold sore actively present it means that the person is having high viral count leading to active infection and in this case the person is contagious and can transfer the virus to uninfected person by an intimate contact.Therefore, in your case there is a possibility that you are infected with the virus and although you may not get symptoms of the disease immediately and can become symptomatic when the viral count become considerably high in your body and skin. I would suggest you to get a blood investigation done at least after 2 weeks so that it can be ruled out that you are infected or not and treatment can be done accordingly. As of now you need not worry as t is not necessary that you will get the infection. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards."

Low hemoglobin, low resistance, protein deficiency are common causes of weak immune system. Infections like HIV infection also weaken immune system. Hashimotos disease is an autoimmune disease and family history of Hashimoto disease is unlikely to cause low immunity. Low immunity is responsible for increased predisposition to various infections. I suggest you to consult your physician for complete health work up to assess blood parameters and other body functions. If any abnormality is detected, it can be treated and thus managed.

            "Since last July, I ve had chronic sinus infections. I took 2 different rounds of 21 day antibiotics (July & Sept) with the sinus infections only to return a few weeks later. I had culture of sinuses done in Nov. and came back positive for Staph. (not MRSA). Was put on another antibiotic and follow-up appt showed fungal infection. I m now on a 15 day treatment (Fluconazole) and 6 week nasal nebulizer treatment (amphotericin) for the fungal. I also tested positive last week for Influenza and was put on Tamiflu for 5 days. Now I have hives developing on my body. All of this is crazy to me....why so many infections (bacterial, virus and fungal) in a short amount of time? I m 44 yr old female, 5 4, 140lbs, non-smoker, non-drinker. Any suggestions on tests to determine if I have an immunodeficiency disorder? Thanks!Hi and thanks for asking us on Chat Doctor. You have been treated heavily with antibiotics, antifungals and even antivirals - all these can undermine your immune system, making you more sensitive to the environment. Other factors that can suppress or disturb the immune system include sudden weight changes, stress, steroids and hormonal dysfunction. You are in your 40s, of normal weight - unless you have had a significant infection in the past that could have lead to immunodeficiency, I do not see the need to test for it. You could do a baseline blood test (full blood count, liver and kidney function) just to make sure all is well after taking so much medication. I suggest trying to rebuild your immune defense. Start taking fish oil generously (2 - 4 capsules daily), vitamin C with zinc, probiotics and antioxidants to start with. Be sure to stick to a nutritious diet rich in lean protein, vegetables and fruits. HY Chat Doctor.  Where the hives are concerned, you could take a short course of antihistamines. Soaking in oatmeal and applying a pre-college moisturizer can greatly help with symptoms. Use gentle skin cleansers and do not rub at your body with a rough towel after bath. Use soft towels and dab gently. I hope this helpsThank you",

Is it right to give him oxygen in the first stage although Sat 97% because we do not know whether it s real chest pain or not? Please help to give your advice. Thanks.Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion no need to give oxygen if saturation on room air is 97%. As too much oxygen may cause side effects too. You should get done chest x-ray to rule out lung infection as cause of chest pain. Get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause for chest pain. If bronchospasm is present than start inhaled bronchodilators. So try to search cause for chest pain and treat accordingly.  No need to give oxygen.",
            "My family has a history of respiratory issues, we live at 4600 ft in Utah, she just returned from a trip to Shadow mountain which is at even higher elevation and her allergies (so we think) flared. One day after coming home she is breathing hard, chest hurts and her oxygen while sleeping is currently bouncing between 89=90 using oxyometer on her fore finger (on her middle finger is was 85-88), our insurance is horrible, our deductible is $8000 out of pocket before any help kicks in so if you think that what I am doing, which is, gave her benedryl, flonase nasal spray, and using provental inhaler while monitoring her oxygen is good hoping it clears up now she is back home, if so, what is the lowest while asleep her oxygen should be and while awake? Thank you for your response Sandy DawsonThanks for asking your question completely understand your problem first thing is normal value as per pulse oximeter ID 98% and there is no difference in saturation of oxygen in state of sleep of awake in a normal person. And minimum normal value should be greater than88%, so during awake or sleep oxygen saturation in pulse oximeter should be more than 88% to 92 % to perfectly oxygenate all the working organs of the body.thanks/regardsfeel free to ask more questions may god bless your family with good health",
            "Hi, my husband had phnemiua and his oxygen level in the blood was 66% his right lung was full and it was going into his left lung he was hospitalized could you tell me all about the seriousness of it all the hospital doesnt explain it to me. thank youThanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Normal oxygen saturation of body is more than 95%. So 66% saturation is considered as very low. Pneumonia is common cause for low oxygen saturation. Pneumonia if uncontrolled and extensive can cause collapse, consolidation and pleural effusion. All these causes non-functioning of involved lung. So oxygenation (main function of lungs) is hampered. This is having poor prognosis. Body can not sustain for long time with this much low oxygen level. After sometimes kidney, heart and brain start loosing their functions due to low oxygen saturation. So his condition is extremely serious. Prognosis in such cases is very poor. So discuss with your doctor and start vigorous treatment to control pneumonia. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks.",
            "I have a family member who is currently in ICU. Last Sunday, she was placed on a ventilator and removed from the vent a couple of days later. Currently, she has been decreased from 60L of high flow oxygen to 40L (they are trying to wean her from the high flow oxygen). While resting, she is tolerating the weaning process well. Her O2 saturation remains in the high 90s to 100 and her blood gases are improving and from my understanding, acceptable. However, if she is turned or physically moved up in the bed, etc., her numbers (mainly her O2 saturation) bottoms out and it takes her anywhere from 30 minutes to as long as an hour to recover and get her numbers back up. The doctors and nurses are telling us that they do not know why this is happening. To me, that is very concerning. Could you offer any insight as to why this is happening? She has been diagnosed with COPD (related to smoking) and was not on any oxygen therapy prior to being admitted into the hospital. They did state that her lungs have suffered extensive damage and when I asked how extensive, they could not tell me because she was unable to perform a PF test. She had an upper respiratory infection, which led to her going to the ER initially.1St of all you are having a good medical knowledge, just for your appreciation. & if, she is having COPD, then probably her baseline o2 saturation would be low only, if you have previous documented data, or if u know about it, then it would be possible reason for this. Or she might be in right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, which would lead to decrease o2 saturation on lying down position from sitting, if so, diuretics will work.In my opinion, if she has improved from ventilator with satisfactory ABG, she may do well with sufficient bronchodilators, & if spo2 at room air is less than 88, then with home o2 or SOS home BiPAP."

Could this all be related and what could be causing it?The answer to your question, if I have, it right is that the symptoms that you report may be related to sleep apnea. With this problem, you are working very hard all night long resulting in fractured and non-restful sleep. The physical work and difficulty breathing may produce a variety of health problems.

My doctor says it could be stress related but at the moment now i can t really think of anything that could be stressing me out. I don t have any stress that i know of. Please advise.Hi there, thanks for asking. As you mention it is a serious issue. It is good that you are checked for thyroid function. Hypothyroidism can bring increased weight, and also slow heart beats. It could be also related to sleep apnea, because it is common in obese people (your BMI is 35.45) and it also could lead to slow heart beats. Other symptoms of thyroid hypofunction are change in your hair and skin texture and also constipation and loss of concentration and may be low mood. Other symptoms of sleep apnea are fatigue during the day and also being sleepy all the time, probably lower mood than normal. If you have allergy, deviated septum, enlarged tonsils, TMJ problem, or you go frequently to washroom in the night, or you have headache in the morning, this could be more likely. It is good that your basic electrolytes and also magnesium and calcium be checked. I wish the best health for you.",

PLEASE help this could make or break our relationshipHi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria chlamydia trachomas, and it easily spreads because it often causes no symptoms.  In fact, about 75% of infections in women and 50% in men are without symptoms. Hence, it may be unknowingly passed to sexual partners. Symptoms in men produced due to Chlamydia include the following:1. Small amounts of clear or cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis.2. Pain during urination.3. Burning and itching sensation around the opening of the penis.4. Pain and swelling of the testicles. The condition can be diagnosed by use a swab to take a sample from the urethra in men or from the cervix in women and then the specimen is sent to a laboratory to be analyzed. Treatment is by administration of oral antibiotics with azithromycin or doxycycline. It is recommended the partner(s) also be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread of the disease. It is very important that you always use condoms during sexual intercourse to lower your risk of contracting or passing on infections such as Chlamydia.

What could be wrong?Thanks for posting your query here. Newborn jaundice which usually appears around day 3-5 of life is usually physiological.

Is there any mismatch between yours and your sons blood group? Treatment helps to lower the jaundice levels, but it doesn't disappear completely. That's the reason that eyes did not clear.You've mentioned that his jaundice has increased and head is bigger. I would like to know his recent blood results - Bilirubin and his CBC. Have you been breast-feeding him exclusively? Is he gaining weight? Also, for increased head size, please get is measured and discuss with your current doctor whether that is normal for his age or not. There are a lot of things to consider - clinical examination, blood test results etc. before diagnosing what's exactly wrong. Please do return with the results of blood test and further answers to questions I want to know, and I will be able to guide you further. Regards Chat Doctor. ",

            "I got new dentures a few months back since then I have this salty taste in my mouth and throat..it even make my mouth feel stickey. What is the cause. I have been to the dr to check if its the meds I use. I have been to a throat nose and mouth specialist and he could not understand what is causing it.Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As you describe in your query that you have metallic taste in your mouth which could be due to dentures as material used in making dentures can sometimes cause these symptoms. Other factors are medicines like antibiotics and medicines used for blood pressure control, gum problems like gingivitis and periodontitis, poor oral hygiene and cold and sinusitis. I would suggest you to chew on sugar-free gum and candies to stimulate salivary flow. The taste of the mouth will get to the normal as soon as we remove the causative factor. Visit oral physician once and get denture examined completely and start treatment accordingly. For now eat fresh fruits and chew hard peppermint candy. Hope your concern had been resolved.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. ESR of 80 indicates severe inflammation.2. Correlation with C-reactive proteins level is necessary. If CRP is also elevated, then possible inflammation anywhere in the body needs to be evaluated.3. Gall stones can induce mild inflammation. Associated with anemia and your previous history of a high normal - I suppose gallstones could be a cause. However, get a CRP done to rule out high inflammation.4.

It was 45, the normal range for this hospitals lab is 65-100. My son s doctor is unfamiliar with this lab and said she would research it and get back to us. Can you please help us? Does his level of 45 mean he has protein a deficiency or does it still have time to rise to normal levels? Thank you.Hello, Welcome to the ChatDoctorThankyou for your questionImmunologic methods for the measurements of protein C include enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay and electroimmunoasay. Normaly in adults it approximates 70 to 140 percent of protein C antigen level of whole pooled plasma level. But in infants total protein is normal at lower level as compare to adults. And Also infants and neonates have lower levels of protein C than their adult counterparts, therefore age based normal ranges must be derived separately for the child Chat Doctor.

            "My son passed away suddenly after suffering three months with MRSA that he got after a simple back surgery to shave the disc off the nerve in his back. The back had to be left open to heal for three months......he suffered so much. The day before he dropped dead, his c reactive protein levels were 178. How dangerous is that level?My prayers are with you for this terrible tragedy. C-reactive protein is a nonspecific marker for inflammation, so the levels themselves aren't said to be dangerous. However, very high levels (which your son had) indicate a very severe inflammatory or infectious process going on. This could happen if the MRSA had spread into his bones or blood, or was somewhere in his body causing a chronic infection. Hope this answers your query. If you have further questions, I would be happy to answer them."

I have been operated in the right axillary lymph node and 2 swollen structures were removed. what are precautionary measures i need to take and what about the chemotherapy, does it have any side effects? what is the diet i need to follow?Please email me at the earliest thanks,Treatment depends upon the individual patient and is planned after thorough testing to determine the extent of disease. Ideal treatment, however, has not been established, and there is no ongoing clinical trial. It is believed that 70% to 80% of patients have spontaneous improvement of symptoms without treatment, although they may have alternating episodes of worsening and relieving of symptoms for a long period of time. Some patients with severe or persistent disease or cases where organ function is threatened (such as breathing obstruction or kidney failure) may require treatment with surgery, steroids, and/or chemotherapy. Rarely radiation therapy may be used. Chemotherapy may include vinblastine, 6-MP, methotrexate, thalidomide, or Sleeve. The ultimate goal of an overall treatment plan, of course, is to use as little treatment",

Sorry to hear about the death of your loved one. It is possible that he had stage 4 cancer of hypopharynx. This is a delicate condition and usually the patient is unable to maintain a good general health condition. Since they had released him from the hospital, nothing much might have been possible from treatment point of view. Hospice referral is for those cases who can be made to stay comfortable with opioid pain relievers like morphine. The goal is to give them peace and comfort.

            "Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...- I have anxiety? can it be cured by acupuncture?I love traveling but now i always go with somebody from the family coz Im afraid it will occur again. Im 30 yrs. old and this illness started when I was 24. Sometimes I catch my breathe but I know its only in the  mind but I cant really help it sometimesHi Welcome to ChatDoctorI have gone through your query regarding cure of anxiety through acupuncture. Anxiety is one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. Many people suffer some form of anxiety occasionally, but others cannot manage this natural response to a stressful situation. When a person experiences a highly stressful or threatening scenario, the mind can be overloaded and fail to develop ways of coping. Acupuncture is an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine. It works on the principle of stimulating points in the body to correct imbalances in the flow of energy through channels known as meridians. This belief is based on the interaction of the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal and water) and having profound effects on internal organs, which are either yin or yang. Traditional Chinese medicine also recognizes the mind and body interacting as one, meaning that emotions have a physiological effect on the body. Western medical practitioners traditionally have questioned the validity of traditional Chinese medicines such as acupuncture. More recently, acupuncture has been recognized as a legitimate treatment for some conditions and is growing in popularity.<>Traditional Chinese medicine relates anxiety to an imbalance of the heart and kidney. Fire represents the heart and joy according to the five elements. The diagnosis is that too much heat in the heart will imbalance the interaction with the kidney (represented as water and fear). This will result in the water organ failing to contain the fire organ rising up to the mind, leading to anxiety. Acupuncture on points around the heart, kidney, spleen and ear are used to treat anxiety. Pro and con of everything are there t least it has no side effects. So you should not worry about it.

It appears that you have not had any prior experiences with death in your family, close or extended, nor do you have any friends of friends who died.

They suppress all the immunity response of the body by inhibiting all the chemicals causing inflammation. Steroids are very useful in bronchial asthma.

I check my BP and during these same time periods it is higher than normal (120/78 <150/95) Could the higher BP be related to the stress of PVCs and lack of sleep?Hello, Actually PVC can only be detected in EKG. Only if there are any symptoms, then one can say it is PVC. Some of these symptoms are flushing sensation in the head and in the shoulder. But it can be caused by another illness as well and other functional factors. High blood pressure may be not related to PVC.

            "Hi my name is Loretta. I have had these symptoms all my life and I would like some answers. When I was 11 my head got smashed against a brick wall, and ever since my face, hand ( I think it was my left side), goes numb, get a headache, blurred vision, see double and I can only see in front of me not the sides of my eyes. I can t function I take pain pills and go to sleep. I got this all the time, it has gotton less and less but I want to know what this is.Hi, Thanks for writing in. Symptoms such as numbness, headache, blurred vision and double vision should be investigated in detail. If you had an injury to the left side of your face then certain nerve injury might be suspected. However, for the eyes, getting examined by the ophthalmologist is essential. You should not ignore the problem with eyes. There are small muscles around the eyes and these help in moving the eyes in a particular direction so that you can see properly. These small muscles are supplied by specific nerves and damage to these nerves can cause problems like blurred vision or double vision. Clinical tests have to be done to make certain any problems with the nerves. Since you also complain of headaches and numbness therefore a clinical neurological examination is also suggested. After examining your doctor might ask tests which might include CT scan of MRI scan of brain and orbits which will show details of the eyes also. Treatment depends on clinical findings. Please do not worry.",

Since you are not able to figure out why its happening and all, I would like to ask you - what sort of bad sight you have? Are you having double vision, blurred vision, any balance difficulty while walking, any other neuropathic symptoms?  If any of the above is present you should meet up a neurologist and may be an MRI might be needed to understand the center of vision in the brain.  The optic nerve also may need testing to understand if any optic nerve pathology is causing this or not. Also, have a check with the ophthalmologist, so we can see if any visual disturbances are due to retina factor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I have had all the scans going. I have vascular malformations in upper thorax , mri s have shown bony lesions in skull and spine with further treatments and investigations pending. I have even had a mouthguard made by the dentist but after a few days of wearing this at night it has blistered my gums which adds to the pain. Don t know where to turn to.Hello, Thanks for posting this question in ChatDoctorLet me tell you the causes of headache are many and one has to find out the exact cause. Headache can be due to migraine, cluster headache, brain tumor, infection, vascular malformations and so on.  I have noted all your problems need to be re-evaluated in a hospital/teaching medical university with Multidisciplinary facility where neurologist/headache specialist / dentist/ interventional radiologist will jointly evaluate you. Their clinical evaluation will determine if you need a brain MRI scan (I am not sure if you have done to rule out any vascular malformation in the brain too). Some people may harbor vascular malformations in multiple sites of the brain. If it turns out to be migraine (which is a diagnosis of exclusion), you will benefit with the following approach1. Acute attack: simple analgesics. Sumatriptan nasal spray. Avoid the precipitating factor. Avoid stress, coffee and lack of sleep. Do regular exercises and good sleep hygiene2. During the chronic phase: You may take one of these medicines: Amitriptyline, propranolol, topiramate, valproate etc. The changes which are seen in the skull and spike are due to the presence of long standing vascular malformation. Hope this helps",

I am 53, 270 lbs, have low blook pressure, low cholestral, fairly active, but stressed. I m an accountant.Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms could be related to tension type headache, which is a benign type of headache related to physical and emotional stress. Some other possible causes like: low blood pressure and blood pressure fluctuations, chronic anemia, thyroid dysfunction, etc. could also mimic this clinical scenario. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a cervical spine x-ray study to exclude chronic degeneration of the vertebral column-complete blood count for anemia- PCR and ESR for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction. I would also advise you to monitor your blood pressure values during these episodes of headache. A brain MRI would also help exclude other intracranial causes, especially if the headache is persistent. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your complaints. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Wishing good health, "

Regarding your sleep disorder. Insomnia is a relatively common sleeping disorder, affecting about one-third of the adult population worldwide.

Your physical health is just as Important as your mental health and both can influence each other. So it is vital to keep your self healthy. Gulping on medicine will not work in any health problem Not even in INSOMNIA unless you take care for your lifestyle, food habits & exercise. Common problems with sleep are often easily ad Chat Doctor.  Taking your mind off the problem can help to relax you and may help you to fall back asleep. Check your pillow and mattress. Is it comfortable ? Keep a gap of 1-2 hours in dinner and bedtime. Take light meals. Take a T spoon of almond oil and 1/2 spoon Turmeric powder With cup of hot milk strengthens mental power gives resistance against diseases. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially before bedtime - both can increase nighttime urination and increase sleep disturbances. Reactions of medicines also cause insomnia. If you can't sleep because of thoughts hovering on your mind, try the Relaxing Breath - DEEP BREATHING FOR SOOTHING MIND. It can help you put aside the thoughts that are keeping you awake. A few stretches can help with sleep aid, too. Meditation also helps to induce positive thoughts & brings sleep.

I have been trying to convince myself that I deserve to enjoy sex, since I have been conditioned to believe I don t deserve to orgasm. I see you listed something called the Masters and XXXXXXX technique? I am beyond desperate for help.Hello Sexual Macedonia or decreased libido is really a distressing problem. You can ejaculate but feel no orgasm. You have been on psychiatric medicines also. See a number of medicines used in psychiatry can cause decrease in libido and can result in orgasmic. Persisting complaints result in dysfunction in family and which further aggravate the problem. A vicious cycle is formed in which individual loses self-confidence. Commonly used medicines like Sildenafil, Tadalafil etc. help to improve erection but these medicines don't improve libido. I would advise you to increase your diet with fenugreek seeds. These have good medicinal value in decreased libido. Apart from that herbal medicines like Wanted forte and Confide can be taken to increase the libido. The medicines can be taken without prescription also and are safe to use. Get your hormonal profile done to find out any hormonal problem. Total testosterone, Free testosterone, and DHEA values are deranged in low libido cases. Hope this helps you, thanks",

You should start paroxetine CR and bupropion Sr initially in low doses. Then increase them. It will help you lot. As anxiety and stress are causes of loss of libido so first remove the stress. You can use tadalafil to stay longer and regain confidence. For libido take some multivitamins like trifold plus Napoleon etc. They all will help you a lot. You should go counselling side by side.

There are procedures (panchakarma treatments) which are done to strengthen inner ear and vestibulococlear nerve. So its helpful even in the case of degeneration. You can use medicated oil (karma tail) which has to be put into ears. But you have to consult an Ayurvedic physician for complete treatment. To avoid these type of problems, as a preventive care, Ayurvedic daily regimens (dinacharya) suggest putting oils into ears (karma Purana) daily.

            "I have something called neroensomiliacia- I don t know if the spelling is correct, but I have a piece of my brain gone. I don t know how else to say it. My questions are 1) the space that is where my brain is suppose to be, what is there now, it is an empty space or fluid there. 2) Besides a weakened side what other things could be affected by this.Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. The condition you are describing, is called euro encephalomalacia, which is a condition characterized by localized softening of brain tissues due to inflammation or hemorrhage. The softening may occur in a specific part of the brain or may be more widespread. The treatment for this disease mainly consists of detecting the underlying cause behind the change in brain consistency and dealing with it properly. In extremely severe cases, damaged brain substance may be removed by surgery. However, the brain consistency undergoes a considerable change due to the removal of the softened brain material.-Regarding your questions, the space that was previously occupied by brain mass, now it is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) is normally produced by your brain, and has three main functions: protects brain and spinal cord from trauma. CSF supplies nutrients to nervous system tissue and removes waste products from cerebral metabolism-As with any surgical procedure, complications may occur. Brain surgery risk is tied to the specific location in the brain that the operation will affect. For example, if the area of the brain that controls speech is operated on, then speech may be affected. I mean the side effects depend on the part of the brain which is resected. Hope I answered to your question. Take care,"

Its a pretty deep cut and I havent fell or cut my self in the mouth. ThanksThanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The possible causes of the cut could be a tooth brush injury or from food particles. Nothing to worry about it, you can take topical anesthetic and analgesics like Anabel gel.

            "hi i m 24 years old girl and i have one child my weight is 60 kg and height 5.4. i have a problem when i wake up in the morning my b.p is very low and pulse rate is high and after breakfast it can more decrease and pulser got higher to 110-120 and b.p can 110/70Hi, Thanks for asking. Blood pressure has a diurnal variation. It is less in morning and progresses as the day progresses. It is more in afternoon and evenings. Pulse rate varies with exertion. Pulse rate does not signify anything unless it is very less like thready or increased to more than 100. Normal pulse rate is 60-100. These variations, if they are causing any dizziness / weakness, then only you need to worry. Otherwise, it is normal physiological variational further queries, happy to help again.",
            "I have been monitoring my blood pressure and heart rate for the past few days.I have recorded my heart rate at 134 at rest. My monitor has also highlighted an irregular heart beat on numerous occassions.Yesterday evening in a space of 30 minutes my blood pressure varied from 132/116/101 to 110/69/121. Is this a cause for concern.Hello welcome to Chat Doctor. It would have been great help if you had mentioned your age and if you are suffering from any symptoms. Since your monitor shoes a raised pulse rate and as per your description it is irregular, I recommend you an ECG initially and if the ECG comes normal, then a 24 HR Holder monitoring should be done which records your ECG for 24 hrs while you go about your routine day-to-day activities. It will show whether you have any heart rhythm disturbances. Variable BP reading in 30 mins seem unlikely. Electronic monitors cannot be perfectly relied upon for BP recording. So I do not see the need to worry about the BP. Checking BP so frequently implies that you are anxious. Please stop worrying about your BP. Check it only once a week at variable times of the day. Wishing you good healthRegards",

            "I have been on Metropolol for 4 weeks, prescribed for palpitations (400 in 24 hrs. per monitor) 50 mg. Also I have white coat syndrome, sometimes pressure rises, been under a great deal of stress, mostly apprehension re: heart tests, etc. Cardiologist says metropolol is good for bp also. I have a monitor, pressure is lower at home, only rises when I maybe active 150/62, pulse in the 70 s and has been as low as 112/60. Still I take readings to the Dr. to let him see that it really is when I am under stress. 50mg made me tired ( Cardio said it would be sluggish), I do feel calmer, had to do 25 twice a day. Still I can fall asleep sitting watching TV and that is not me. I think I could try 25 per day, that is how I started out, but my pressure in theDr. office was 162/63 so he changed it to 50. Now I notice my pressure is higher anywhere from 112 to 175 with the bottom # in the 70 s and my pulse in the 60 s. My Dr. didn t mention the fact that it was compared to at home readings, also because I am calmer in office reading was only 136/62 He thought all the numbers were good, but yet they were higher than before when I took them at home. I don t get it, I thought BP meds reduced your pressure.With respect to palpitation, that is the sensation not the extra beats. The extra beats may not be harmful or even require treatment. If you have found no underlying heart disease or dangerous rhythm, the primary concern is to relieve your symptoms and anxiety. Finding nothing dangerous does not necessarily mean that heart rhythm is not the source of what you feel but knowing that it's not dangerous is often treatment enough. The best way to interpret your blood pressure is to take only recording done on schedule. Single measures should not prompt concern, particularly no those done under stress. Record your blood pressure on a schedule every day. It should be taken seated after a 10-15 min period of relaxation. A two-week average is what you use to make decisions about the need to take a medicine and its effect."

I take BP medicine (Covance 25). I drink alcohol. I have no chest pain but some times slight giddiness experienced.What is your advice please?Hello welcome to Chat Doctor. Your ECG reports suggests possibility of lack of blood supply or ischemia of the anterior and inferior walls of the heart. So you should get evaluated for the same. As you mentioned TMT effort tolerance is good. But what is more important in a treadmill test is whether it is positive or negative. A positive treadmill test increases the possibility of heart blockages. A negative stress test implies no detectable blockages in the heart. Please also do a 2d echo to see the contractile function of the heart, the valves and the flow between the valves. Please specify the treadmill result, and do a 2d echo. If treadmill is negative and 2d echo is normal then you need not worry about it. If either treadmill is positive or 2d echo shows regional wall motion abnormality, you should visit your cardiologist and get an angiography done. Wishing you good health. Regards",

I am a scientist by profession and physically active and walk for more than an hour everyday and i am doing this for the last 15 years.Hi, In your TMT test result: mild effort tolerance means that the test was terminated quite early, and ST depression usually indicates the presence of ischemia. But you should know that sometimes the TMT test can have false positive results, so I would advise you to have another test done, the best can be stress echocardiography, it is more specific test than treadmill test.

            "Hi my name is Beverly. My question is when a narcissist is not empathetic toward others does that mean they are also this way towards their moms and dads too, when the parent express their hurt verbally to their daughter? or does this lack of empathy only happens to other people who are not parents?Hi Beverly, A person with Narcissistic Personality Disorder do have the need for constant admiration, and usually a complete lack of empathy toward others. Such people often display snobbish attitude and are often condescending towards others.  If a person is suffering from Narcissistic PD, such behavior will be generalized towards all, including close family members. All said, the lack of empathy isn't part of only narcissistic people and can happen in other personality types too. I would suggest you to talk to the person concerned and may be tried to convince her to meet a psychiatrist. Best wishes.",

            "My sister has severe rages, abusive tendencies, and appears disorganized. She has had a long history of escalating quickly. She is unable to carry on a normal conversation without becoming angry.  Her attitude is \"Its all able me\". she lacks empathy and appears to act jealous of others. She has never been married nor has she had children.  However, she wants others to think she knows more than the person she converses with. It seems the older she becomes the worse she is.  Am I correct in saying that she could have a personality disorder. If so what personality disorder could it be? I thought maybe on the line of Narcissism.Hi, Yes, she may be having a personality disorder, though she would also need assessment for other mental disorders as they are often co-morbid with personality disorders. As to the type of personality disorder, some of the traits that you mentioned are consistent with a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. However, it is usual for people to have traits of more than one personality disorders, thus having a mixed personality disorder.

Since blood tests require specific reagent to show whether the levels of different substances in your blood fall within a normal range, thus they can help you and your doctor learn more about your health and can help find potential problems early, when treatments or lifestyle changes may work best, but blood tests alone cannot be used to diagnose certain medical problems.2. Blood tests allow a doctor/physician to see a detailed analysis of any disease markers, the nutrients and waste products in your blood as well as how various organs (e.g., kidneys and liver) are functioning, so if examination or history doesn't reveal much about patient ailment thus laboratory tests are tools helpful in evaluating the health status of an individual3.

            "I was told that I am in the early stages of emphysema this week at the VA hospital where I go for various treatments, I also did not do very well on the exhaling portion of the breathing test I took for them. I am 72 years old and have been smoking off and on for approx. 40 years. The last startup,after a 12 year break, was 9 years ago after my wife passed away. CURRENTLY I DON T SMOKE A LOT ,5 A DAY. What is your best estimate for how long I have left?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Emphysema is an older term. Nowadays COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) term is used. It includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. And COPD is progressive disease. We have to manage it to halt the progression of the disease. So better term for COPD is chronic manageable disease. Lifelong treatment is needed. And for this you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST) to know the exact severity of the disease.  As treatment of COPD is based on severity of it. You need to follow below-mentioned steps simultaneously for effective treatment. 1. Quit smoking as soon as possible. 2. Start inhaled bronchodilators3. Enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise are done. 4. Get done vaccination with pneumococcal and influenza vaccines for prevention of future lung infections. If you strictly follow these life expectancy will be very good.",
            "Hello I am almost 18 years old and I think I may have COPD because I feel short of breath. It all happened at a friends house about 5 years ago and suddenly when I came home an hour later I lost my voice and got a chest infection. then It never stopped I still feel short of breath. Back then all my friends parents pretty much smoked. Ive had this for a long time. I do not feel fatigued or had any chest pains. I went over there everyday after school. Stayed for a few hours and left. Will I die? I m rather worried.Hi COPD/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has 2 main forms: emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema occurs when there is enlargement of air spaces due to destruction of the walls of some air passages in the lung. Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed if the person has a productive cough for at least 3 months in each 2 consecutive years with all other causes having been excluded. (You would need to have a mucus producing cough for 3 myths out of each of the last 2 yrs). Symptoms may include productive cough, breathlessness and wheezing. It is diagnosed based on history of smoke exposure and symptoms, physical examination. Blood test and imaging studies will need to be done if it is suspected by your doctor. COPD is not normally seen in young persons There are other causes of shortness of breath and your doctor will check for these. They include: anemia, asthma, lung infections, heart disease, inflammation of the lung, blockage of the upper airway such as the nose. You need to see you doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms I hope this information is helpful to you",

She doesnt have oxygen as her levels are fine. we went to chest clinic this week and she breathed in tubes for the nurse before we went to see professor in chest clinic. He said to her to carry on using her 3 different inhalers and nebuliser. I asked how her breathing was and he said very bad. He said she had bronchitis and will get it over and over again. They dont explain much really. She is not eating properly and i am trying to get her to eat small portions often. She has extremely sore throat after taking steroids, a sore mouth and teeth and she is very thin. I am just wondering how far advanced she is with this disease as nobody seems to say anything. I know they cant say really, they just said she will carry on getting infections and it wont get better, which i know already. Is there stages in the disease i need to know about. Is she in a bad way etc?Hello Thank you for asking. There are a lot of patients with This complains that I see in my everyday routine. From your information I can give you some helpful data. Emphysema of the lungs combined with chronic bronchitis represent a single lung diseases called COPD. In some patients it is the emphysema symptoms with dyspnea that predominates not bronchitis and in some others is bronchitis with cough and sputum. COPD is a chronic lung diseases mostly in smokers or ex smokers, or in patients suffered for a long time from uncontrolled asthma or asthma not treated or in patients that live or work for a long time in dirty environment. To determine the diagnosis of COPD it will be done a test called SPiROMETRY with bronchodilator. If the test is positiver than the next step is to define the grade(stage) of the diseases. There are four grades A, B,C, D. According to the grades it is the treatment. But I also recommend a cardiologist consult because in most cases COPD is associated with cardiac diseases.

The mucus that I bring up is thick and dark green (sorry for the gruesome details) I seem to have a constant headache and feel constantly tired.Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor Productive cough may be related to bronchitis. Viral bronchitis is more common than bacterial bronchitis. These infections may be associated with additional symptoms such as headaches, fatigue. Additional symptoms such as ear ache, sore throat, decreased appetite. You may want to consider the use of bucolic agents. These would help to reduce the thickness of the secretions so that it can be expelled easier. Examples are bipolar, guaifenesin, Mucomyst use of an analgesic would help with the headache. Paracetamol can be used. Rest and the use of enough fluids would also be important. I hope this helps",

The fact that you are noting sputum means that this is the most likely cause for you. This can be treated with oral anti histamines and topical steroid nasal sprays. In most cases it is caused by an allergen. If this can be identified and exposure reduced then symptoms should also reduce.(2)HERD- gastroesophageal reflux is also a common cause. Some persons may not be aware of the reflux and present with the cough only.(3)asthma hope this helps",

I can be doing absolutely nothing and have trouble breathing, sometimes waking me up at night.

You may need a short course of oral steroids to help reduce the inflammation in the chest. Continued inflammation is often the most common reason for the persistent coughing.

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that you are suffering from Erasmus also known as Lock jaw, and it is a symptom of some underlying disease or problem and is not a disease on its own. It can occur due to a number of causes like traumatic injury to the jaw joint, jaw joint disorders, dental infections, nerve related disorders, oral submucous fibrosis, TMJ/TMD etc. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated, and he can advise you investigations like Orthopantomogram that is a full mouth x-ray, MRI scan etc. to rule out the exact cause of problem and treatment can be done accordingly. As of now you can start taking anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen, muscle relaxant like Chlorzoxasone, do warm compresses and take a soft diet. Avoid excessive training to open mouth. Avoid stress as it can add up to your problem. Take proper rest. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. ",

The diagnosis is suspected on the ECG and confirmed by ultrasound. Among the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy are age, intensive practice of one or more sports, obesity, prolonged hypertension. The seriousness of hypertension arises from its impact on a number of organs (target organs). The complications that can develop at their level explain the increased morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. The heart is one of the main target organs, and one of the first consequences of elevated blood pressure (PA) is left ventricular hypertrophy (HVG). The heart adapts to high blood pressure by increasing the volume, resulting in an increase in oxygen consumption by the heart muscle. As a result, coronary revascularization may gradually become insufficient. Progressively, the diastolic function (see DIASTOLE) then systolic (see SYSTOLE) will alter. In addition, this increase in volume of the left ventricle may cause ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extrasystole for example) and poor revascularization of the deep layers of the myocardium (risk of INFARCTS). I advise you not to stop your antihypertensive treatment (keep it for life)To practice a hygiene of life with especially a diet without salt (look at the dash or dietary approach to stop hypertension see https://www.yyyyyyyyy.yyyyyy.gov/yyyyyyy/yyyyyy/public/heart/hbp_low.pdf)Walking every day (45 minutes per 24 hours)And consult your cardio as quickly as possible. May this informations help you best wishes",

            "Hi,I am a 42yr old female recently found out I have an enlarged heart. What s shocking is I have always exercised and worked out regularly from as early as age 16. I do not abuse alcohol nor have I ever abused drugs, in the past my blood pressure has always been on the lower side, also low blood count . I guess i am just confused as to how this is now my situation.I am sorry I really can t afford to pay at this time for the answer. I was mistaken, I thought it was free advice.Thank you for your time though.SCHello.First enlarge heart is a very vague terminology. Size of hear increases in two fashion. One is increase in thickness of wall called Hypertrophy and other is increase in cavity of heart called Dilatation. Again Hypertrophy is subdivided into two types inward enlargement called concentric hypertrophy of heart and another is outward enlargement of heart called eccentric hypertrophy. Whereas Dilatation of heart is called Cardiomyopathy. And Cardiomyopathy has various subtypes depending on etiology In short, the enlargement of heart including Hypertrophies and Cardiomyopathy; in both cases, the cause is not sure always. Any person at any age of life can be developed these disease. So in my opinion, better to go for diagnosis of which type of heart disease you are suffering and up to what extent having this disease then start the treatment that depends on condition and etiology. Thank You",
            "i want to ask you doctor awoman has 50 years old and she had ahyperatrophy of the endometrium a pathological examination was done after surgical removal of the endompetrium and the endometrium was completely benign and ther was no atypia by the way i am adentist and iread that women after the age of 50 the have hyperatrophy of the endometrium because of estrogen secreted from the adrenal gland and some other sites of the body 2 weeks after surgery the thickness of the endometrium is 12 cm (thick) i think should this woman be given progestrone hormone to prevent the hyperatrophy she was given tamoxifen drug for breast cancer treatment for 6 years but ithink that there is no relathionship between tamoxifen and hyperatrophy because she did not use tamoxifen since 1 year after the curetage surgery why there is ahyoeratrophy (12 cm) what is your opinion by the way i am adentist and ihave some informations about gynecology and woman hormonesHi, Endometrial hyperplasia and hypertrophy is somewhat different anyway the exact histopathological diagnosis is preferable. Estrogen plays a role in endometrial hyperplasia. Breast cancer patient should have an annual gynecological check up to rule out the same. The clinical trials like ATC, ATLAS has reported about it. But chance of malignancy is less. So you should better follow the normal breast cancer follow-up protocol."

            "Hello my 10 month old child has a dark purple line around his lips, like he wearing lip liner. He keeps getting a temp of over 38 and has a panful chesty cough and wheeze.  Do you know why he has that? His oxygen levels are fine, got them tested today at the doctors.Hi, If I were your treating Doctor for this case of severe pain under the left rib cage, I would come up with three possibilities, these include:1. Anemia is one of the common causes of lip discoloration. It is often related to iron-deficiency anemia, but any type of anemia can be responsible.  Hemoglobin is responsible for the naturally red color of blood. A deficiency of hemoglobin or red blood cells will affect the lip color accordingly. In severe cases this discoloration may be slightly blue and becomes more pronounced with cold weather.2. Cyanosis associated with a higher than normal level of deoxygenated blood. This can be caused by any number of pulmonary diseases as obstructive bronchitis, pneumonia. Emergency medical attention is necessary if blue or purple lips are associated with a diminished level of consciousness, cold and clammy skin and difficulty breathing. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing your baby good health.",
            "sometimes the veins in my lips turn blue(especially lower lip). I am a healthy 49 years of age. I had my dr check it out (lips were not blue at that time). He listened to my lungs/heart /checked my circulation. He could not find a problem. I do have anemia and take daily iron supplements. I also take a proton pump inhibitor every day + pill for my Hashimotos disease.  I am eating healthy and exercising regularly. I am baffled as to what is causing this. It bugs me.Hi I did read your query and concern. It seems that you might be experiencing episodes of cyanosis in which bluing of lips occur. Most commonly it is due to a heart problem or a lung problem or a circulation problem. However, if all of these are normal, there is a condition known as methemoglobinemia caused by many genetic hemoglobin types. Does anyone in your family have the same problem? You can get it checked by an expert hematologist or if the symptoms do not cause any problems to you, you can send the blood sample overseas to Chat Doctor. Hope this help swish you a super healthy life ahead do let me know if you have any more questions for me.",
            "Hi my mother has parkinson disease/ dementia and heart failure she has recently been complaining of a spongy feeling under foot. Also she has had at least four occasions in which she struggles to breath turns blue around the lips becomes very weak and wets herself. I have reported this to our local GP and her mental health team all of whom seem puzzled she is due to see her neurologist next month but today she has said she is getting a very cold feeling down her body and a feeling of fluid trickling in her headHis understand your concern. Blue lips mean cyanosis and cyanosis need to evaluate in detail. Blue lips plus she struggles in breathing then respiratory illness or obstruction is most likely. Cynosis require immediate medical assistance. It is occurred due to decrease oxygen saturation in blood. So do consultation to physician as early as possible and get help. Take neurologist or psychiatrist opinion there after but 1st priority is to consult physician for medical problems. I hope I have answered your query. Thank you.",

Noted your infant is 10 month age and repeated chest infection with blue lip. When tissue not getting enough oxygenated blood then blue cyanosis can occur by deoxygenated blood or less blood supply. Here as he has repeated infection, so screening for immunodeficiency has to be look for by detail history and investigation. Keep his hogan proper ... Passive smoking avoided....

Iam regular in applying sunscreen during the day whether at home or outside. But I dont see much change in my face color. Ism a veg and I take lot of veg and fruits. Yet there is no glow in my face. Can u suggest some remedies. Ian planning to take some laser sessions for my face discoloration. Will it work for me...can u pl suggestHello, Welcome to Chat Doctor Discoloration of face is rather a broad term. It can include any hyperpigmented problems. The cause for your pigmentation has to be ascertained. A consultation with a dermatologist practicing cosmetology will help in diagnosis. Sunlight induced photo-pigmentation, freckles and UV spots, Plasma, Seborrhea Melanesia, Addison pigmentation, Vitamin B12 deficiency, acanthuses Nigerians etc. are all causes of pigmentation and needs to be ruled out. Please continue using sunscreen and re apply every 3-4 hours during the day. Your diet also seems to be fine. Chemical peels and microdermabrasion will help if you take many sittings provided you rule out internal causes of pigmentation. Hope this helpedTake care",
            "My son Cam is just about 6 mths old, and lately myself and others have been noticing his hands and feet turn blue ( cyanosis) and sometimes around his mouth. The majority of the time, it s while he s having a bottle, or just waking up. His hands and feet turn blue at bath time also, although I always warm up the house extra, and make sure his water his warm, even adding warm water as I go. When he was just two- days- old, I noticed his lips and around his nose were blue, so I called the nurse down to my room, and she told me he just needed to burp. After he did, he was still blue so she took him down and checked his vitals, and at that time all was fine, must have been gas she said. I have an appt made with his doctor for the 19th and but should I insist he be seen before then Also he was tested for Cystic Fibrosis when he was 1 mth due to a prolapsed rectum. He had the sweat chloride test done, and the tech who administered it said she thought she got enough sweat , when the doctor called with the results, he said he was in the clear based on the amount of the sample , but seemed hesitant, all at the same time. Do you know if it s possible for a sweat chloride test to be wrong? Also no matter where he s touched, regardless of pressure, his skin turn blotchy red.Hi, I understand your concerns, but blue colored skin means that there is not enough oxygenated blood supply reaching this area of skin. This could be due to a problem in the blood vessels or due to a problem in the heart that is unable to pump enough blood to different parts of the body. This needs a thorough examination by echocardiogram to exclude any chaotic heart disease. I recommend also to repeat the test for cystic fibrosis in another laboratory to make sure of the result. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

Is it true? and is there any way i can lighten her complexion :(Thanks for asking via Chat Doctor, bluish color of skin is due to -The lungs are not getting enough oxygen. Since oxygen is what makes blood turn red, blood cells without oxygen remain blue (\"cyanosis\"). The underlying blood is moving sluggishly, so the normal veins underneath that carry blue, oxygen-poor blood back to the heart are more noticeable. Consult your pediatrician, get examined. If every thin is OK then do nothing at this age. Regards"

I can understand your concern. Your symptoms point towards either an underlying chronic depressive disorder or a dysthymia disorder which is a milder variant. You might also require assessment of your personality profile. Active suicidal thoughts are a psychiatric emergency.

Suicidal ideation is normally an after effect of depression. Not clinical depression. Disappointment in life as unforeseen events take place can also trigger disappointment and usually leads to a depressive state for some time.

            "Hey, I am a young male that recently turned 20, my question is about facial hair, my facial hair seems to be growing slowly and I am just worried that, like a few people I know will only grow in certain patches and stop there, how old until my beard is fully grown, will acne prevent hair from growing on that spot, does acne cream stop hair growth because of the chemicals in it, do acne scars without a doubt mean a bald spot for my beard in that scar area. At what age should I expect full growth, also, I think I have noticed my beard growing sligthly quicker when I exercice, this beeing from the raise in testosterone I assume right? I know my questions are a little all over the place, I would really appreciate an asnwer to all of themHi Many, Welcome and thanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor. So you are worried about the growth of facial hair (rather beards) in uniform manner. Now to solve your queries:1. Our growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time. It all depends on the family pattern and genes which we carry from our ancestors. So, basically it will be depending on your parents side.2. Neither acne nor acne scars and creams prevent the growth of hair. None of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general. But if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face.3. Yes due to exercise we do have a bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth. Lastly there is no medical treatment in this world which can cause growth of hair in only beard area and your questions are exactly the same which a young man have (and even I had when I was at your age) so don't worry and be happy.With the best health and beard wishes, Chat Doctor.

Skinlite cream is a prescription product for pigmentation/plasma over face. Skin lite cream contains a potent steroid, mometasone. It should never be used on face for long because a potent steroid like mometasone can cause the skin of face to become photosensitive, Acne ridden and thinned out with telangiectasias.

My scrotum in the area that touches these rings is red and itchy. Its been there for about 5 days now and isnt disappearing, what could be the cause and solution?Hall, The fungus that most commonly causes JOCK ITCH is called TRICHOPHYTON QUORUM.

The advancing edge is redder and more raised than areas that have been infected longer. The skin with in the border turns a reddish-brown and loses much of its scale.  Jock itch caused by T.

            "I have a disease called depersonalization disorder. I ve been stuck in it for the past year. It means a loss of identity or personality.

If u on treatment then visit again to your psychiatrist(I am not visited yet pls visit to psychiatrist) and tell him about this he will definitely help u to come out of this and move from hopeless world to hopeful world."

            "For twenty years since I left a went scuba diving in connection with a cruise vacation, I have had daily problems with balance. Dr. Timothy Hain, Northwestern University, Chicago, seemed to believe I had a damaged vestibular system. One other doctor initially thought that I suffered with mal de dubarquement. Dr. Hain seemed to rule out this condition. What should I do in the way of trying to determine if anything can be done to alleviate my balance problems?Hello! I read your question and understand your concern.  I agree with your doctors that your balance problems may be related to the inner ear. But they also may be caused by the brain problems or vertebral artery narrowing. The long time you refer with these problems, is more indicating an inner ear problem.  Vestibular tests can diagnose disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and perilymph fistula, whicChatDoctormonly occur after head injury; and bilateral vestibular cytotoxicity, whicChatDoctormonly is a side effect of medication. I would recommend tests like electronystagmography, electrocochleography, rotational chair test, posturography, fistula test to find out a possible inner ear problem. A brain MRI may be needed if everything results normal. Hearing pathway tests (audiometry, auditory brain stem response, electrocardiography) can also be used for the same purpose, and are frequently combined with vestibular tests. After finding the cause of your problems than we can choose the right treatment. Hope to have been of help! Best wishes!",

Thanks, Jane! I didn t realize there would be a charge, my funds are limited, so I ll passDear Jane, The queries asked in this forum are answered free of cost. Please feel free to ask your questions. The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to pathology in the Vestibular Apparatus in inner ear (it is associated with maintenance of body posture & balance) most probably Labyrinthine or Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Vestibular sedatives like Betahistine or Linearizing preparations (to be taken only under the guidance of a Physician). If it still persists, then you need to consult your Physician/ ENT Specialist & get a complete clinical examination done. Investigations like estimation of blood pressure, blood sugar levels, serum electrolytes & vestibular function tests will be required to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms. There is no need to worry, you will be fine. Till then, maintain adequate HY Chat Doctor. And also take precautions of getting up from bed slowly & avoid sudden head movements.

Now at the age of 32, lupus is back in the picture. Why tell me not to worry, cause there isnt anything to worry about, but its on papers that I am positive to have lupus.

In acute renal failure, kidney function is lost rapidly and can occur from a variety of insults to the body. The list of causes is often categorized based on where the injury has occurred. Prerenal causes (pre=before + renal=kidney) causes are due to decreased blood supply to the kidney.

He was recently diagnosed with infection in both kidneys. His heart and lungs and prostate was fine. Can you please tell me what you think could possibly be the problem?In my opinion it's not inflammation its swelling in legs, ankles and penile area you want to say. The function of our kidneys is to clear our body from toxic material produced and prevent blood sugar and proteins to pass in urine. In case of some kidney diseases and infection kidneys loose these functions and proteins are lost in urine resulting in decreasing body proteins and disturbance in body fluid balance. That is the reason fluid accumulates in body specially dependent areas like legs ankles. Don't worry this will improve after starting medications.",

Haven't had all that many problems in long bones that stay straight even with fractures. Then, pain can be from various causes.

If both legs are affected, you should be checked about spinal injuries, since you had a skiing accident.

If I bite the side of my cheek and then i am brushing my teeth with this bacteria-laden toothbrush, why is this bacteria not infecting me, yet it is cause for such serious infections in hospitals?Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. Enterobacter cloacae is a member of the normal gut flora of many humans and is not usually a primary pathogen. In other words, it is a communal or friendly organism having a symbiotic relationship in which one organism derives benefit while causing little or no harm to the others. Few healthy humans are colonized, but the percentage increases significantly with long term care facility residence or hospitalization. Colonization is an important prelude to infection. Individuals who have previously received antibiotic treatment, have comorbid disease, and are being treated in ICUs are at greatest risk for infection. Since you are otherwise healthy, you are unlikely to get any infection, even if this organism has grown on your toothbrush Regards ",

And my research has lead me to believe that it was legionella bacteria that infected me. What are the symptoms from this type of infection? As it was exactly 1 year ago that I contracted this disease.

Then Friday there was a sign about high chlorine levels. Could the chlorine be the reason my mouth is irritated?Hello thanks for consulting at Chat Doctor. Adding more chlorine to pools with unbalanced pH further degrades the quality of the pool water. Highly acidic pool water can erode dental enamel.

MY INSURANSE WONT PAY FOR THIS AND I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PAY IT OUT OF POCKET.Hi there, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. One of the causes of elevated alkaline phosphatase is obstruction to the bile flow. This obstruction could be either inside the liver substance or in the bile duct. In these cases the liver panel would be abnormal. There would be a raise in the bilirubin level especially the direct component. An ultrasound scan may show dilated bile ducts. If the obstruction is inside the liver substance the ultrasound scan may not show it and a liver biopsy may have to be done to confirm it. This obstruction could be harmless as in gallstones in the bile duct or may indicate serious conditions like malignancy, primary biliary cirrhosis etc. There are other causes of high alkaline phosphatase also. Bone disease can cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase level. Pregnancy can cause a raise in alkaline phosphatase. Is this answer helpful?"

As far as management is concerned, first thing is cause of acute pancreatitis is it a GALL STONES?  Or something is else.  Second is how severe is the attack? For this we need to get some investigations like serum glucose, BBC, LDH and AST along with UREA CREATININE and serum CALCIUM LEVELS.  The most important aspect of the management is giving rest to the pancreas by keeping Will by mouth to patient. For this purpose NG tube has to be put in .

You should have a doctor exam your loved one in order to systematically rule out certain conditions before treating. I recommend a doctor's appointment as soon as possible for the patient.

            "I fainted two days ago in the middle of the night in a hotel all by myself ,  I hurt my self badly, big cut in my forehead as well as several incisions in the back of my head. I was completely out for about 2 to 3 hours until I finally came back. This is not the first time I faint, but it is the first I really hurt myself plus I was alone. I was diagnosed in mexico city in a hospital by a neurosergeon as having had  a \"Sincope Neurocardiogenico\" do not know how to translate that into english. How serious is this? Can this be cured or at least controlled? I travel a lot by myself for working reasons, I am 53, and I need to travel, needless to say I am very scared this may happen again!!Welcome to Chat Doctor. Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness(LOC) for a few minutes, loss of consciousness for 2-3 hours does not appear to be due to syncope. It would be prudent to rule out any cardiac arrhythmias by getting a 24 hour Holder testing(Mobile ECG) to rule out any bradyarrhythmias or abnormalities of rhythm and rate. A EEG, other causes of LOC need to be looked for, this includes seizures, TIA and other cause. Syncope needs to be checked for causes of orthostatic hypotension like Chat Doctor. Other causes of syncope like micturition /sneezing /neurogenic/vasovagal or carotid sinus syncope needs to be looked for. It would help to get a thorough neurological, cardiac and medical check up done to establish Theo cause of such symptoms.",
            "Hi, im a 20 year old female. I just went and had a my second tilt table test today. the results of this one where scary. i didnt really walk out of the hospital assured that id be fine. my last TTT was feb of last year. i passed out after 8 min with a reading of 76/46. i was then diagnosed with NCS. all well and good. ive been on mididorine for 6 months and my cardio said he wants to meet again but wanted another TTT before to see how the new med was working. this time i made it all the way to the nitro admin. within the first few min after that i passed out with a reading of 78/46. i was slow to come around this time and they recorded what they called a second degree heart block. when i asked questions about it all the doctor said was not to worry, that i was too young for a pacemaker. but he didnt really answer any of my questions on it. im looking for some info on what exactly this is. how it will effect me at 20 and why on earth would i need a pacemaker. thank you.Hi, If you are having recurrent syncope, then first medical and behavioral therapy is tried. If there is no response, then one can think of pacemaker. During giddiness or impending syncope, following maneuvers should be tried, Leg-crossing with simultaneous tensing of leg, abdominal, and buttock muscles, Hand grip, which consists of maximum grip on a rubber ball or similar object, Arm tensing, which involves gripping one hand with the other while simultaneously abducting both arms. Plenty of oral fluids and increase in salt intake may also help. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",
            "Hi, Im a 57, 130 lb 19 year old girl who recently had my 5th encounter (on saturday) of going unconscious unexpectedly and for 5-6 minutes.  It was around 3 in the afternoon, I was not dehydrated and had already eaten lunch.  I have a long list of allergies; the most dangerous are shellfish and  penicillin.  Every time I come back to consciousness I have large red blotches and hive on my arms and upper thighs.  Previous Doctors have thought my fainting spells were caused my anaphylactic allergic reactions but recently another doctor claimed I have vasodepressor syncope and the hives are caused from over-heating (which I often get hives from).  I was wondering If you also thought I should see a cardiologist or should continue on new allergy medications.Howell come to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, apart from the allergic condition if this is pure syncope then this could be due to cardio vascular disease or central nervous system related disease and these both possibilities need to be ruled out, if this turned unremarkable then one can think about the allergy, but syncope is very uncommon in your case, with eruption of haves hysteric attack may be likely, hope this information helps."

            "my friend was told that he has an irregular heart rate 39-40bpm.and that he is lucky that he wake up in the morning.and that he needs a pacemaker to be put in.and for him to go to emergency room.but my friend didnt.what is going to happen to this person if he doesnt soon get the pacemaker in?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of heart block is more in your friends case. It is conduction defect in heart when impulses are regularly conducted. So heart is not beating properly and hence blood circulation in the body is also not proper. pacemaker insertion is must for him. If he is not willing for pacemaker, he may develop brain damage (paralysis) due to decreased blood supply to brain. Sudden stoppage of heart is also seen due to heart block. So sudden cardiac arrest may occur, and it is life-threatening. So convince him for pacemaker insertion. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

            "my mother is having pain in chest from almost past one week now, we consulted cardiologist & after ECHO test he suggested that one of the artery has only 19% blood supply to heart, she is diabetic also. is angioplasty required now. Please note that her blood cholesterol is absolutely normal from almost past one year.HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your description. A 2D echo cannot show blockages in the heart arteries. It can show if some walls of the heart chambers are weak following a heart attack. Depending on which wall is affected, the artery which is blocked can be estimated. But the severity of blockage cannot be estimated by a 2 D echo. A 2d echo can give you the pumping function of the heart, which normally is 55-60%. Only an angiography can quantify the blockage severity. So if she has undergone an angiography then it may mean there is 81% of block and 19% of artery is functioning. If she has not undergone angiography then this 19% can be the pumping function of the heart (by 2d echo) which is low. So if angiography is not done then you must go ahead with an angiography to evaluate severity of blockages in the heart. Further, decision regarding angioplasty can be done on basis of results of angiography. If angiography is done already and the blockage is greater than 70% severity., then angioplasty must be done. Wishing her good health. Regards",

            "I had opent heart surgery in Dec 2013. I still get very fatigued at times...experience shortness of breath...and experience pain in my chest and back. I also tend to cough up a lot of pflegm...Is this normal after open heart surgery? I just don t know what s normal and what s not and when I should be concerned and seek medical attention....Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern. Its extremely important that you get evaluated for the productive cough or phlegm which is evident in the postoperative period of open-heart surgery. This can be a harbinger of chest infection. This should be detected and treated rapidly. For this I advise you to get a baseline 2dimensional echocardiogram and a high resolution digital x-ray chest. In many cases empirical antibiotics will help. This consists of twice a day cefuroxime protein for 5-7 days. This will cure infection in 99.9% individuals. Fatigue after major surgery is very common, due to the metabolic impact created by the surgical stress. This can be improved with good nutritional intake. In all cases avoid smoking and alcohol. One pomegranate a day for 3-4 months from here on will help to build the stamina and combat infections. Its extremely important that you report to your surgeon at the earliest to deal with your health issue along with health reports like baseline EKG and complete blood picture. Consultation with an expert cardiothoracic surgeon will help to formulate expert management. Post your further queries if any. Thank you.",

Not only does it strengthen the qua Chat Doctor.  Secondly if the muscles are strengthened the surface of the bones that rub against each other and cause pain in osteoarthritis are less prone to do so and the further rate of degeneration comes down.

With their muscles becoming stronger they become more confident of ambulating around the house as well. I am not very certain of the extent natural remedies and alternative medicines can help.  And rest assured that inflammation arising in osteoarthritis is least likely to affect the heart and brain. There is no correlation.

The preferred treatment of type 1 diabetes is injectable insulin, the dose of which is according to the levels of blood glucose. However, constant monitoring of blood glucose is important because a too high dose of insulin can lead to hypoglycemia and coma and a too low dose can lead to high blood sugar levels. So dose has to be carefully adjusted as per the blood glucose levels. In type 1 diabetes the pancreatic beta cells are unable to produce enough insulin to take care of the needs of the body. Oral hypoglycemic agents are not effective I type 1 diabetes because there is not enough beta cell function since Has act by increasing insulin action. You will need to monitor blood glucose at home with a glucometer and adjust insulin doses accordingly. Hope it helps.",

Welcome to Chat Doctor !  I understand your concern. Diabetes may develop due to various factors. The general mechanism is that isle cells of pancreas are not producing insulin which helps in keeping your glucose levels in check or insulin produced isn't acting on the glucose to keep levels controlled.

An enlarged prostate is a common condition after the age of 60 years in males. To confirm if you really have an enlarged prostate, you should get an ultrasound scan done and this must also include urinary bladder volumes before and after urination. An enlarged prostate causes retention of urine in many people and that is responsible for increased frequency of urination and urgency. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate includes, urinary urge, increased frequency of urination even in the night, pain during urination and sometimes blood in urine. Significant retention of urine can cause urinary tract infection also. It will help if you also get PSA (prostate specific antigen) levels tested at least once every year. This will show any risk of developing prostate cancer. Mild prostate enlargement is treated with medications like fin astride and tamsulosin. Severe prostate hypertrophy requires surgical treatment.",

The episodes you describe of staring blankly needs to he investigated further. These episodes are unlikely to be related to deniers disease or any problem related to the ear. The episodes are usually accompanied by amnesia and a change in consciousness. They usually originate in the brain. You need to visit a neurologist or a psychiatrist.

I have also been diagnosed with Vertigo resulting from the inner ear.Hello, You may have a condition known as OSCILLOPSIA which refers to fields of vision that are in motion with head movements.  The underlying pathological mechanism involves a loss of image stabilization by loss of reflex control of eye muscle control when a person has their gaze fixated.  Things such as toxicity, infection (most importantly meningitis) or side effects from antibiotics can cause the condition.  Desalinating disease such as MS can also cause this condition, as well as abnormal movements of the eyes referred to as nystagmus. I recommend you seek an opinion from a NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIST.  Vertigo from inner ear problems will not produce this phenomenon. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. ",
            "Our nearly 6 month old, completely healthy and happy granddaughter sways her head constantly when on her tummy or is being held. It is not because she is sleepy. At first we thought it was because her head / neck muscles were not strong enough, or because she was swaying to the music. She is sitting up fine,alone, though she still has to concentrate on sitting up. Her head is still when she sits up, perhaps because she is concentrating on her balance.

Can you please explain this to me, and is it or can it be life threatening? I have Fibromyalgia, could this be associated with her getting this problem. Your Sincerely Michelle MokeHi, A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. The cyst can range from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball. This is not a serious complaint. Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth, soft lump under the skin. They are made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid, called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement. There is no need to seek medical attention unless she experiences pain, swelling or stiffness of the area. They can be removed surgically if needed.  Chat Doctor. ",

The complaints you give point towards gastroesophageal reflux disease (HERD) or \"heartburn\".HERD is usually caused by, impaired expulsion of gastric reflux from the esophagus.it may be triggered by consuming food in large quantities, or specific foods containing certain spices, high fat content, or high acid content and lifestyle choicest treatment of heartburn depends on the underlying cause. Medicines such as H₂ receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are effective for gastritis and HERD, the two most common causes of heartburn. Antibiotics are used if H. pylori is present also healthy lifestyle changes like eating and sleeping at regular intervals and regular sleep patterns.thank you, wishing you good health.",

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry about. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. There are some reasons that might be responsible for heartburn. First, you should know that typical heart pains have some characteristics. They usually are retro-sternal pains likes quizzing, tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, neck and jaw. Furthermore, they last from 5 to 20 minutes. Long lasting pains are not typical heart pains, and in your age ischemic heart disease is rare. To exclude ischemic heart disease I would recommend a cardiac echo, a full blood analyze and a street test. Another reason of heartburn high be a gastrointestinal problem. So you should consult a gastrohepatologyst and maybe a fibrogastroscopi.Also, you have to exclude a Selectric problem doing a topical X-ray. After all this we can better judge what we are dealing with and how to treat it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor. ",

I have no clue what this could beHello. Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. I read your query and understand your concern. Now, the description of the heartburn you provided, is with the highest probability from the stomach, as the origin. This symptom is called paresis, and is produced when the highly acid content of the stomach is returned to esophagus or, sometimes, throat and mouth. This can happen from various reasons, mostly from a disbalance between acid-producing and acid-inhibiting factors in the stomach and from the lower esophageal sphincter insufficiency. Without digging further more into theoretical details, I would suggest you to refrain from certain food and beverages that favor acid production and/or inhibit acid-inhibiting factors and/or lower the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter:- alcohol and tobacco-chocolate- tea, coffee (Anthony derivatives)- spicy and grilled food, and pickles would also recommend you to start a course with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI): omeprazole 20 mg x 2 tb/d for the first two weeks, then 20 mg x 1 tb/d for four other weeks, and accompanied by risperidone x 3 tb/d. Also, you should not lie down, but sit up or stand, for at least 90 minutes after you have had your last meal. If the symptom persists after all these measures are undertaken, I would recommend an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, for further investigation. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards.",

I woke up this morning and the pain is still there but not as bad. It feels like I have a stitch all over my stomach and hurts when I walk around.

The different types of food and Chat Doctor.  Tomato based products, too much milk (Contains calcium which stimulates acid), caffeine in coffee or tea, alcoholic beverages, all add to the problem. Smoking will make there flux worse because of its effect on the sphincter at the junction esophagus and stomach.

If needed you can take it twice a day. If symptoms persist after 4 weeks, I advise you to see digestive disease specialist for further work up. Wish you good health."

            "34yrs. Cerebral palsy . Epilepsy . 24hr care required. Been on tegretol cr and phenobarbitone for years to help control seizures. Neurologist prescribed keppra for 2yrs. No side effects but experienced 1-3 seizures daily. Weened off keppra and started sodium valproate . Within the first week she had experienced sedation, vomitting. Then bloods showed valpro levels low, dose increased. She experienced hypothermia , sedation, vomitting. She lost the ability to swallow food and drink. Bloods showed her phenobarb levels were toxic. Is this common or unheard of for these medications to interacte this way?Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The side effects as experienced by the patient are known with the medications she has been given, however, they are fortunately uncommon.  The only method of treatment would be to titrate the dose of medications till the desired efficacy is reached, as per the tolerance by the patient, and the Chat Doctor.  I am sure she would recover from the side effects of medicines with proper care and there is no need to worry.  Best wishes,",

It is basically impossible for them to go to a specific location and their side effects are all over.  The exceptions are when the organ has a particular reason to grab the medicine, not the other way around.  So liver damage or kidney damage or growing organ damage are common. Accumulation in fat like in the skin can be a pattern. But not one side. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care ",

I cannot have a flu shot because of a serious allergy to the preservative used in most shots. Is there a way I can get this without a shot? If so, would it be of help for me to get it now?Hello, The serious allergy to preservative in most shots is not clear, and you may be referring to the egg protein if you have egg allergy. The influenza vaccine should be taken in the autumn before winter sets in for it to be effective. People with egg allergy can have the influenza vaccine provided the lowest cut off limit of egg protein in the vaccine is used. As there are many manufacturers, the egg protein in the vaccines vary and now the companies have to quantify the amount of egg protein for egg allergy patients. A 2-step approach is used (if the egg allergy is severe or anaphylaxis, and you definitely need the flu shots because of asthma, COPD etc.).10% of the vaccine is given s/c, then the patient is observed for 30 minutes, and if fine, the rest of the 90% of the vaccine is administered.

            "Hi doctor, my husband is undergoing kidney transplant, I would like know more about the transplant rejection. Could u explain this in detail?The transplant rejection is condition in which cells from the transplanted tissue of a donor initiate an immunologic attack on the cells and tissue of the recipient. The donated organ, called an allograft if the donor and recipient are unrelated, is transplanted into the recipient, called the host. Rejection can occur when the host’s immune responses are directed against the graft. The rapidity and reversibility of rejection depend on the various mechanisms involved, such as peritransplant ischemia and mechanical trauma, preformed antibody interactions with graft antigens, alloantigen-reactive T cells, and abnormal tissue remodeling.

His cancer has been extremly aggressive on his back bones and hips. Any advise about his current decision?Discouraging chemotherapy may make him ineligible for transplant because his disease should be in at least very good partial response before transplant. As he had already undergone autologous transplant twice, he may be considered for allogenic transplant which will have good graft versus host disease and reduces the chances of recurrence. But the patient should be eligible for transplant. He may also be tried with newer Chat Doctor. ",

Treatment of posttransplantation TMA relies on removal of any precipitating factors, relief of symptoms, and PE or plasma infusion. Therapeutic options for posttransplant TMA, including plasma therapy and targeted complement inhibitors can be used to treat those suffering from TMA. With the latest guidelines, there have been patients with TMA who were completely treated at the end of one year with hospitalization and maintenance immune suppression.

            "dear doctor,i have very swollen, red tonsils that are now COVERED in white spots which are now turning yellowish and some grayish-brown. i went to the doctor and they performed the swab and told me it wasnt bacterial so its viral. i know when it comes to viruses your body just needs to stay hydrated and fight it off. my issue is that in the last 5 months ive had painful tonsilitis at least 6 times. I feel my tonsils are doing more harm than good for me, should i get them removed? also what are the best home remedies for this?Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. As a home remedy for tonsillitis, you should do gargles with warm salt water or with chlorhexidine & water in 1:3 dilution. They will not treat the viral infection but prevent super-added bacterial infection. You can also take lozenges available OTC. Also take plenty of water and warm liquids.  Take paracetamol with ibuprofen for pain relief, fever and inflammation. You can get your tonsils removed if you have recurrent tonsillitis. You have said that you had this problem 6 times in 5 months. Guidelines about tonsillectomy says that it can be done if tonsillitis occurs 7 times or more in a year or 5 times or more per year for 2 years consecutively or 3 times or more per year for 3 years consecutively. So, see whether you fall in these criteria or not. Tonsillectomy can also be done if tonsillitis is severe and affecting day-to-day life. Consult a good ENT surgeon for the same and decide further. Hope this will be helpful. Do ask if any more question. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Take care.",

Most people with CMV will never know and may manifest no symptoms if they are healthy. Once infected, your body retains the virus for life, but it may never disturb you. However, whether symptomatic or not, it is a cause for concern in pregnancy. It spreads from person to person through body fluids. There is no cure for CMV but Chat Doctor. The symptoms you present may signal an active CMV and when any of those symptoms appears, it's always good to see the Doctor for evaluation and management. I will advise you take an HIV test to confirm your negative status as it could be one of the things that can weaken your system and make you prone to developing an active CMV infection. Other thing can weaken your system and increase your risk of CMV symptoms are bone marrow or organ transplant, malnutrition, long use of steroids, chemotherapy/cancer.

My husband a 43 y.o. male has been hospitalized a second time noe within the last 3 months. the first time they DX him with guillian barre syndrome. they treated with IVIG for 5 consecutive days and then he remained in hospital a total of 9 days until he could walk and then was discharged. this time, s/s started the same as before. N/T in bilateral feet that migrated quickly up to knees and then tohips and then to elbows and wrists. Then intense burning ache in the joints that followed the same progression. MRI show lesions in the brain, none in spinal cord or brain stem. Lumbar puncture showed only elevated proteins (67). they checked for lymes, encephalitis, meningitis.ets... The first time in Novenmber he last all pheripheral reflexes. This time they sre dull only at this point. I am concerned that they are missing something. My husband states the pain is 9/10, and the only meds that help are Neurontin and toradol. Narcotocs and muscle relaxers do not help at all. We questioned CIDP, MS, transverse myelitis, and they have no answers. They havedone another MRI of brain and brain stem/ neck area. We do not know the results yet, and they are questioning whether or not to do another lumbar puncture... I have requested west nile test and tey just ignore me...I have been an RN for 24 years as well.Hi, I can understand your mental status as per the narration of current symptoms of your husband. But the fact is that the neurology is still beyond the scope of advanced medical science, the way in which it presents are taking many more coming decades to be fully evaluated. Rather than exposing him to repeated MRI radiation, I suggest to focus more on physiotherapy and supportive care. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",
            "neuro leigon found on front right lobe of the brain,fluid found on left mastoid bone in middle ear,chronic sinus tract,these three 3 finding may not be related but woul like to know if left untreated what can i expect as far as mental health ,and congnative abilities what kind of expected response.I read your question and understand your concern. First, these three may be related to each other or not. A cerebral MRI would help a lot of understanding better the nature of the cerebral lesion and its natural history. Of course the pathologic examination (biopsy) would make a definitive diagnosis. The location in case the lesion grows would affect some of your cognitive abilities, such as thinking, reasoning, planning, taking decisions etc. Recommend brain MRI.

            "I have had a lesion on the anterior side of my knee for more than seven years.  Recently it swelled up to the size of an orange and when the swelling subsided I had two firm multifaceted lesions.  I had an ultrasound today, which showed that the lesions were hypoechoic.  Is there still a possibility that these lesions could be malignant?HIT hank for asking to Chat Doctor I think the important is clinical sing and symptoms you have not said anything about your clinical problems most of the words you used here are being used by radiologist which most of the time does not create an exact sense and so the radiologist most of the time advise it for correlation with clinical condition, to rule out the possibility of malignancy, there has to be several tests to be taken in hand for final diagnosis of malignancy, one can not say anything about it like that only, if you are suspicious for malignancy then MRI is the initial test to be done first then numbers of other test are there but that can only be considered when MRI is indicative of some malignancy have nice day.",
            "In the last two weeks I ve had a CT scan, Brain MRI, 3 treatments of Solu Medrol. On Wed of this week I had a spinal tap, so of course I m sore and tired and today (Friday) I went in for Spinal MRI. They tried it twice and each time it started I got very cold and clamy. I felt like I was going to vomit. They discontinued the MRI since my body couldn t take anymore. I wasn t stressed about the MRI today, so I don t think it was due to anxiety. I had MRI last week of my brain and I was completely fine. After today s attempt at getting the spine MRI, I went to my car to leave and I ended up vomiting. I ve felt nauseated all day and now I m burning up with fever. Should I be worried? If I m still feverish tomorrow, should I see a Dr.? Thank you for your adviceI read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. It is puzzling though, I have never encountered any report of such effects of MRI and furthermore there is no reason for the MRI to cause any of those symptoms, it's a harmless exam, doesn't carry any sort of radiation. So I think it must be a coincidence you must have some infection causing the fever, nausea and vomiting which is manifesting its symptoms. I hope to have been of help."

While I dont want to rob his chiildhood, I am concerned that he is so far behind his peers.  Is there a natural food that willl helps to get things started?**1. Onset of puberty is overtly visible in females, in contrast the early signs of puberty in males are not visible [which might be your concern].2. You should visit a GP or Neuroendocrinologist regarding his puberty issues who will order a blood test to find out whether there are any problems with the children hormones [testosterone] or may also order an MRI or an ultrasound to check the glands to find out whether they are working properly.3. Well-balanced diet [proper nutrition], adequate sleep, regular physical activity is generally the best management guidelines.PS. If you are concerned about lagging behind his peers, just check for any hormonal disturbances like: narrow shoulders, disinterests in girls, shyness, being fat, non-visible Adams Apple",
            "My son age 15, Acts very inmuture ,has gained alot of weight, eats alot, does not have any signs of going into puberty, no hair, voice change,or any of the normal signs should we have him checked or is this just delayed puberty? Very short for his age 4ft 11 138# he is very active . I guess the rapid weight gain has me most concerned, pluss he still acts like a 10 yr old. He is in 9th grade and has withdrawn from alot of the kids he has grown up with because the are so much ahead of him and he feels he is being left behind. Any suggestions? should we check any medical problems?Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Pubertal changes occur in boys and girls around the age of 13 and sometimes 12. The reason the change is the presence of hormones such as progesterone and testosterone. In some cases the weakness of the hormone delays the puberty. Sometimes it is also possible some hormones inhibits the activities of the above hormones. Rapid weight gain could be suggestive to inhibition and thyroid problems. Hyperactivity also points towards this direction. Please consult a competent physician to ascertain the cause and to have proper diagnosis. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.",

In such cases puberty may come between the age of 16 to 20 yrs. I will also suggest you to consult an endocrinologist after a year or so if till then also you do not get puberty. He will get you tested your sex chromatin, sex hormone levels and some other tests to evaluate the causes of delayed puberty."

In general/casual words it would mean that you are not having emotions to the degree that you are supposed to have i.e. the amplitude of the emotional reaction to persons/events/relations is very much less than normally expected. Hope I have not confused you more! One word of caution though on Internet and self diagnosis....... believe me, diagnosis is definitely not just about ticking a checklist of criteria. You can probably tick weather you have some biological symptoms like lack of appetite, disturbed sleep etc. but when it comes to qualitative symptoms like Macedonia, blunted affect, tangential thinking etc. etc. etc.....you better leave these to professionals.

            "Hello.  I am a 22 year old male.  About 9 months ago, maybe more, I noticed in the shower that my left nipple was sticking out farther than my right.  I promptly squeezed it and it had a discharge much like a pimple before it was empty.  After this, nothing else came out that day, but the nipple has remained larger on the left side, and occasionally (once every few days,) if I squeeze it, it will discharge a tiny bit more.  I cannot identify any lumps of any kind to indicate gynecomastia or breast cancer, and am really stumped/concerned as to what else could possibly be causing unilateral nipple discharge in a 22 year old male.Dear, We understand your concerns went through your details. A woman can normally have some type of nipple discharge throughout her adult life. For men, nipple discharge can indicate a problem. During hormone imbalances such as adolescence, the male gland can be stimulated. This hormonal stimulation can result in gland growth (Gynecomastia), tenderness, and produce milk and or nipple discharge. If squeezed / traumatized enough, a clear fluid can be express from almost anyone. This is normal but hurting tissues this much is not a good idea. With gland stimulation, the discharge can be milk like or thick like a pimple. Nipple discharge is a concern if:bloody or fluid colored red, pink, or brown looks like pus especially accompanied by inflammation and or fever one sided (unilateral)happens without squeezing the gland sticky and clear or a cloudy black or brown.

It is diffused in nature and can not be localized. Therefore, the Pain you are having seems unlikely to be of cardiac origin. Palpitations can be cardiac related. I'll advise you to get an ECG done at the time of these palpitations and a 2D Echo to rule out any possible cardiac related abnormality. Cardiac arrest means stoppage of heart and a person with cardiac arrest does not write a question by himself. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

My endo lowered my dose and now I am tired, and in more pain plus skin conditions that had resolved have returned and my BP is rising. I want to bump the dose back up.Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Hashimotos disease or thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid as a result of an immune attack on the thyroid. Now usually in about 95% of the cases, Hashimoto results in an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism. In a very small percentage of patients that have Hashimoto antibody the thyroid becomes overactive. But this is very rare, and I must say that we rarely see it. I can say that your symptoms (Pain, excessive tiredness, profuse sweating, palpitations,anxiety and irritability) are very indicative for Hyperthyroidism. It would be helpful if you send me a copy of your blood test report, so I can evaluate the results and to know which tests you have already done. A diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism Can be confirmed with blood tests that measure the levels of thyroxine and TSH in your blood. High levels of thyroxine and low or nonexistent amounts of TSH indicate an overactive thyroid. Thank you."

            "I have a 14 yr old daughter who has been diagnosed as Borderline Intellectual Functioning by a local Psychologist. She was diagnosed as ADHD at about 7 yrs old. She struggles in school and social environments (common, I know). She is very impulsive and has a tense relationship with her siblings. She is currently being treated by a Psychiatrist and we have previously had her in counseling for her behavior. She has been on numerous medications (stimulants) and is now using a non-stimulant Strattera. We don t really see any change. Methylphenidate seemed to work best for the longest period of time in her life, but through puberty, it seems to have little affect now. We feel as if we are running out of options and we want her to be happy in her life. We re also afraid that her siblings will end up resenting or disliking her, due to her behavior. She has a 16 yr old sister and 3 x 11 yr old siblings (2 brothers and 1 sister--triplets). So there is plenty in our house to lose focus on. I also (Dad) have been diagnosed as ADHD, so I fully understand where that came from. I would like your opinion on other potential treatment options: medication (stimulant, non-stimulant, combination; non-medication, etc.)? Thank you.Hi, thanks for the query. It seems that you are having a lot of trouble with daughter right now. If ADHD remains incompletely treated, it does a toll on children self-esteem also & too many times, in a desire to get noticed, get some appreciation, child engages into undesirable behaviors which are at present your main concern. We need to formulate a multimodal treatment plan for her consisting of medications+ parent teacher management training (PTMT). If methylphenidate has worked for her & if there are no contraindications for methylphenidate, we can shift from atomoxetine (strategy) back to methylphenidate & hike the dose to maximum 60 mg/day. As a part of parent teacher management, we can engage into token economy, contingency management, role plays, time out etc. which are taught by Psychologist to both the parents & teachers in school. Hence, do contact your Psychologist for PTMT; if you need further help do revert to me. Good Luck"

Latex gloves - usually used for examinations2. Antibiotics - if given before procedure3. Aspirin or NSAID based gargle or mouthwashes4. Chlorhexidine mouthwash5. Local anaestheticsKeeping in mind the above possibilities, your dentist now needs to exclude which ever ones he thinks not possible (as your daughter was not exposed to) and a skin prick test should be the follow-up test after this.

Please also avoid those food items which contain pine nuts as ingredients.2. As you have a serious anaphylactic reaction requiring epinephrine, future management plan would be to keep an epinephrine pen along with you for unanticipated anaphylactic reactions.

Always has sweaty palms.Hello, Extreme coldness in the shin & feet are commonly due to peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, etc. It is due to decrease in the blood circulation in the arteries or narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits that decrease the blood flow. You are suggested to get him clinically examined by a GP. Get all the blood workouts, Urinalysis, CT, MRI, Nerve conduction tests, etc. done at the earliest. He should also get cholesterol tests, chest x-ray, Duplex scanning, an echocardiogram, an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), an exercise stress test done to detect arteriosclerosis.  If diabetic, get blood glucose level controlled at every cost. Neglect may trigger the symptoms. His vitals should be normal. His treatment will depend on the pathology detected, reports of the investigations obtained & his clinical condition. In the meantime give him vitamin D, vitamin E, B6, B12 rich food or its supplements. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care "

            "i fell down steps and my leg bent underneath me and the front part of my calf hit concrete steps and formed a knot.  i have been putting ice on it from wednesday thru saturday and bruise has spread about 9 inches by 6 inches. are there ways to tell of signs of a blood clot.  i have no pain walking on leg or anything like that.Signs and symptoms of excessive blood clotting depend on where the clots form. For example, symptoms of a blood clot in the heart or lungs may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and upper body discomfort in the arms, back, neck, or jaw. These symptoms may suggest a heart attack or pulmonary embolism (PE). Signs and symptoms of a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg may include pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the lower leg. These signs and symptoms may suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Signs and symptoms of a blood clot in the brain may include headaches, speech changes, paralysis (an inability to move), dizziness, and trouble speaking or understanding speech. These signs and symptoms may suggest a stroke. Regards Chat Doctor. ",

I still have a lot of swelling and continue to wear a compression stocking.  I cant figure out if the swelling remains from the vein procedure or the blood clot and Im afraid that I will have to live with this kind of swelling from now on.  Is that the case for Factor V?  Is this continued swelling to be expected?Hi, Thank you for your query on Chat Doctor. Positive for factor V Leiden people are prone for clots formation in the blood circulation system. Symptoms will depend on the site and extent of involvement. Continue to wear stockings. Prophylactic use of anticoagulants like aspirin, warfarin may be required to prevent further clot formation. Prolonged sitting or lying on bed further increases the risk of clots formation. Consult the doctor for further advise on management. Hope I have answered your query. Regards.",

Was that a mistake. Im very scared. What should I do and when will I start to feel any signs of painHi....than for your query.  The risk of blood clot dislodgement is high within 24 hours of extraction. There are many reasons of blood clot dislodgement like repeatedly rinsing your mouth, sucking, hot food consumption, touching with tongue again and again. If you have used warm saline rinse within 24 hrs of removal of tooth then it may be a cause of blood clot dislodgement. If there is no problem then u should not worry about it. But if u feel any problem then surely go to your dentist he will treat accordingly.",

Thanks for your query. Unpleasant Chat Doctor.  You seem to be going through a stressful period currently, due to the loss of your job. So, it is quite possible that your sleep problems are being caused due to your stress.  The night sweats can also be a manifestation of nighttime anxiety / panic attacks. However, there are also a few medical conditions which can result in frequent night sweats like hypoglycemia, certain infections, hormonal imbalances (such as in menopause), etc. The recent worsening of this sweating could also be due to the flu and the associated fever and chills.  So, I would suggest that you try stress management and relaxation techniques in order to tackle your stress. If you are feeling overwhelmed by your stress and the related symptoms, then you need to seek professional help from a psychiatrist. There are effective treatment options available - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help him overcome your stress-related problems. Wish you all the best. "

            "the biggest drawback of doctors or health care professionals in general is that they focus on curative aspects, rather than preventive. If theres a heart problem, they say ok well cut u up and correct the defect. But its my personal experience that they dont provide health education on how to prevent the heart problem in the first place. I know - I have faced it with a couple of my close friends who underwent surgeries. Life style related illnesses are largely the fault of the people - and the health professionals as well.

Im low in iron and vitamin C. second thing is i have a bump on my head thats been sitting there for years but it dosent hurt do you know whats problem? and can hep?Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Random bruising on body can occur due to many reasons. Vitamin C can cause easy bruising because of lack of collagen network to form a strong framework. Thus, a weak framework can lead to easy bruising and thus easy bleeding. Since, you are having easy bruising, vitamin C deficiency is probably the cause for it. Vitamin C supplements will help to restore vitamin C levels. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. ",

Ive been having small little brusing on inner arms some as large as an eraser and small as the width of a pencil lead. Ive also seen a bruise on my thigh the size of a quarter. Think there can be a connection?Thank you, MaryHi and thanks for the question, Is anemia is associated with easy bruising, the main possibility to be exploited and excluded is a bone marrow pathology, a lesion with the kidneys with inadequate secretion of a hormone called erythropoietin, responsible for both red blood cells and platelet production and a spleen defect. The platelet production is very much linked to red blood cells production. Low platelets generally lower than 50.000/mm3 could lead to easy bruising. A complete blood count with platelet counts measured is needed. If low again, the opinion of a hematologist might count significantly in the diagnostics and management. Thanks and kind regards, Bain LE, MD.",

People platelet and blood coagulation disorders can bruise easily.2.) Being deficient in vitamin C, your more prone to bruise easily, due to weaker blood vessels.3.) Rare genetic disorder called on Hildebrand disease, which prevents the blood from clotting properly. This disorder affects at least 1% of the population.4.) Bruises in elderly people may be due to thinning of the skin.5.) Medications6.) Maybe you just hit something harder than you expected.7.) Heavy and rigorous exercise may cause bruises, which results from microscopic tears in blood vessels underneath the skin. Visit your doctor for further investigation and treatment plan according to it. Regards.",
            "Several months ago I would get a pain in my right leg and maybe a day after brusies would show up, this went on for about 3 months.  The leg pain stopped for maybe a month and now my right are was paining me and I have 2 litte red bruises.  What could be wrong?Dear patient thank you for your question. Here are a few causes of spontaneous bruising and some tips to help you figure out what you might have1) Blood disorder:a. On Willy Brandt disease/ Hemophilia: A blood disorder due to lack of coagulation factors. It results in spontaneous bruising and is easy to rule by a simple blood test called COAGULATION PROFILE.b. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count can result in such symptoms. A coagulation profile will help to diagnose this condition as well. Leukemia: My intention is not to scare u but practically speaking it is a possibility especially if u feel fatigued and have bone pain or headaches. Please get a complete blood profile done2) Liver disorders of your coagulation factors come from your Liver hence a Liver disorder mostly cirrhosis can result in such symptoms. Get an LFT done. Yellowing of your eyes/jaundice may hint at a Liver disease however it is not a rule3) Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin C and b12 deficiency can result in bruising as well. The test is time-consuming and expensive so just take a multivitamin tablet every day and see how u feel after 2 weeks4)Graces disease: This is a thyroid disorder and may be accompanied by excessive sweating feeling hot increase appetite yet wt loss. A thyroid profile is warranted. More common in females5) Excessive medication/ Injury: If you are taking any medication please read the label to see if hematoma or bruising is a mentioned side effect.Also, if you go to the gym or run a lot this can happen strongly urge you to discuss this with your go and reach a diagnosis. In the meantime for your pain here is what you can do1) Ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day2) Cold compression over the bruising3) Elevation of the leg while sitting down Hope this helped."

            "I had a endoscopy and colonoscopy done a couple months ago and they found 4+ ulcers and a polyp they would normally find in a 50+ year old person... and a few weeks ago I started having bright red blood in my stool. I have also been bruising easily and been feeling a little dehydrated and I would like to know what is going on with me?Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Bright red blood on toilet paper after you've had a bowel movement may be a sign of colon polyps or colon cancer, rectal bleeding can indicate other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears (fissures) in your anus. Examination by a doctor helps in confirming condition. Biopsy from polyp is necessary to snow type of polyp. Removal of polyp can be done through colonoscopy using snare method. Bruising is common in aged people due to thinning of skin and weakened vessel. As you have blood in stool and bruising need to get examined by doctor. Possible causes are if you are any blood thinning medications, platelet disorders or clotting system abnormality. Consult your doctor for further management Hope this helps you. Regards",

Blood in the stool should not be taken lightly. The blood could have come due to injury to the rectum while passing hard stool, or it could be due to piles. These are not serious problems, but there are other very serious causes for blood in stool which can only be diagnosed by a Gastroenterologist who will have to do Colonoscopy to rule out any serious problem.Meanwhile, Chat Doctor.

I dont have the healthiest diet but this has NEVER happened in the past. What are possible explanations for this?Hello! Thank you for the query. Bright red blood on the surface of the stool or on the toilet paper is very characteristic for hemorrhoids. Due to constipation, bad diet, steady lifestyle, veins gets enlarged in the rectal area what causes hemorrhoids. When wiping, you get hemorrhoids wounded, so it gives a blood. I suggest you to start with diet improvement. Increase fiber rich products and mineral water intake. Avoid fatty foods. Start probiotic supplementation. Remember to wash your rectum after every stool. If this won't help, you should consult a surgeon and have rectal examination. Hope this will help. Regards."

            "my abdomen feels hard and not soft when i palpate it...is that nromal? also why do I have thin (a bit thicker than a pencil) stools and very hard to defecate and not alot per day...almost feel constipated..been almost 2 weeks like that..im on naproxen and detrol..could these be the reason?Hi. This is not normal to have hard abdomen on self-palpation at all. Naproxen and metro can cause constipation. Hard pencil like stools are indicative of an anal stricture or an anal fissure. The harnesses on the abdomen can be due to xenoliths impacted all over the abdomen in large bowel. I would advise you the following:Get an examination by a General Surgeon, get a clinical diagnosis, get large bowel enema done along with the laxative to be taken in the night. Have site bath. Take probiotics. Avoid all the foods and beverages causing hard stools",

Kindly helpHelloPassage of hard stool exerts pressure on urogenital organs which generally secrets and stores seminal fluid So that spells out due to pressure by stool loaded colon which further augments when you put strain during defecation. So you need not worry, correct the constipation, and it will disappear automatically You can take laxative or stool softeners in case of acute constipation you should take lots of fresh fruit and green vegetables with dietary finer supplements which will increase the roughage and facilitate smooth passage of stool.

            "I have a lot of trouble with abdominal adhesion, had surgery in may and had to have 4 of small bowel removed because it was kinked so bad. Then in July extreme pain again where it had attached to abdominal wall.. needless to say recovery after surgeries these close back to back. Any suggestions to prevent these?? Didn t know I had to pay for answer. No money sorry   I did have adhesion surgery open again in July for this so surgery in may and in July, so surgeon is doing everything to prevent anymore surgery anytime soon due to the surgeries being difficult due to them being so close.   And the degree of adhesion , he doesnt want me stuck in a always surgery situation.Hi, Thanks for writing in to us. I would like you to know that adhesions in intestines are a difficult problem to treat fully. As mentioned, multiple surgeries may be needed for the same reason. In your situation, adhesions appearing again is the first suspicion. It might be causing a subacute or acute intestinal obstruction. You have not mentioned which part of your bowel was removed. Not all adhesions can be seen on ultrasound and CT scan. Right now you must first get an abdominal erect X-ray done to see for any significant sub acute or acute obstruction. Following this the surgeon may put you on observation and pain medications or may decide to operate again if there is indication of the intestines getting blocked. The pains should be reported to your doctor and investigations completed at the earliest. Hope this helps",

Perforated bowel and intestinal adhesion can be caused by benign and malignancy. It is usually seen in benign conditions and only few cases are malignancy related. It will help to know if there is any mass or infection on CT scan that might be the cause for such a problem. Lowering of hemoglobin and hematocrit is a concern. Please get a peripheral blood smear done and this is a simple test to know if you have anemia and what type it is.DEXA scan is a low intensity X-ray to measure bone density. When there is bone cancer, the density of bone in affected area changes as compared to surrounding bone. This difference is bone density can be appreciated.",

My doctor thinks that it is possible I have developed adhesions due to the fact my pains started about 5 or six weeks after I had surgery. If I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy and whatever tests and they are fine. How can they figure out if I have adhesions?Hello! Thank you for the query. The main problem with adhesions is that all tests and examinations can be negative and the only way to rule them out is surgery. Sometimes, abdominal CT with contrast (so called enterocolitis) can show some narrow areas of intestines but it doesn't have to. So it is advisable for you to have this CT scan and if it will come negative, you should ask a surgeon for help. Hope this will help. Regards.",
            "i had a few surgerys and lately i have been getting lots of abd pain... i had a ct scan done to check for hernias or tumors since i had them quite a few times and had them removed. Dr told me that you can see adhesions on the ct scan.... i have diabetes and im a little worried, because he stated that he would have to do another surgery so that the abd pain can get relieved. is that true that you cant see the adhesions on the ct scan?Hi. The adhesions can be seen on the CT Scan if they are well-formed. The secondary effects of adhesions in the form of intestinal obstruction with proximal dilated bowel loops can be nicely seen. Diabetes has to be under control and well managed for the best outcome of any treatment. I would suggest to under Enterocytes as it is better than CT scan and Ultrasonography to see the intestinal obstruction, kinking and so on. You may then definitely go for the next surgery as advised to you. Internal hernia can also give the similar symptoms but will be different on CT or Enterocolitis."

Shingle occurs when the virus that causes chickenpox starts up again in your body.  The virus usually affects one nerve only and on one side of the body. Symptoms occur in the area of skin that the nerve supplies. The usual symptoms are itching, tingling, pain and rash. The rash could turn into clusters of blisters. Preceding to the appearance of these symptoms, you may have a headache and also feel like flu like having symptoms. Kindly consult Dermatologist for clinical evaluation and management.

Should I get the shingles vaccine.    Will rinsing my hands in peroxide prevent the spread?Hi, Shingles are basically reactivation of chickenpox virus, anyone who had chickenpox may develop shingles. Shingles are contagious but less so than the chickenpox, but It's important to note that the varicella virus (chickenpox virus) is contagious not the shingles. That means direct contact with shingles blisters, would cause chickenpox in someone who has never been infected with the virus or someone who never been vaccinated against chickenpox. In simple words shingle cause chickenpox in close contacts and shingles never cause shingles in close contacts. Coming to your case, since you had chickenpox in childhood you are immune to virus, and you never develop chickenpox virus, and you can safely take care of your mother. Since you have chickenpox in the childhood you may develop shingles in adulthood, and it can be prevented by vaccination. So it's better to take vaccine. Rinsing your hands will definitely decrease the chance of contamination to others, so you should maintain good hand hygiene by frequently washing both hands.Finally, one more thing, once the blisters scab, shingles are no longer contagious. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

I had never had a problem with it before, until two days ago I had taken one and notice I felt like I was short of breath, and no matter how deep I would breathe in I couldn t get enough air. the feeling eventually went away so I didn t think to much about it. except I woke up today and took one early in the morning 8:00 and started to notice me getting short of breath again. Several hours later I noticed a tingling sensation in both my arms, It gradually became more severe then moved up to my face, my whole face, including my tounge. I went to tell my girl friend who was sitting beside me what was goin on and noticed I was slurring my speech and couldn t help it. I was going to go to the ER, but when I steped out the truck and started walking around it all jus slowly died down. So question is what could have caused that? and if it was just the adderrall why is it affecting me differently now?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of transient ischemic attack (TIA) is more. It is sudden occlusion blood vessels and thus stoppage of blood supply of some part of brain. So momentarily, that part of brain functions less and gives the symptoms of sensory disturbance (tingling), slurred speech, died down etc. So better to consult neurologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of Central nervous system (CNS).2. MRI brain 3. Blood pressure monitoring 4. ECG and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. 5. Cholesterol levels. So better to diagnose yourself first and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

IS THIS SOMETHING I SHOULD MONITOR OR IS THERE TREATMENT THAT CAN BE DONE IMMEDIATELY TO PREVENT FUTURE TIA OR STROKE?Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I would like to explain that a transient ischemic attack lasts less than 24 hours and normally less than one hour. Your symptoms may be related to a transient ischemic attack or a stroke. I recommend you to go to the ER and consult with a neurologist, perform a careful physical examination, blood pressure monitoring, routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, ECG and a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical vessels). A brain CT scan or MRI scan if possible is necessary to establish the diagnosis. A transient ischemic attack must be monitored in the ER as an alarm sign for future strokes. The cause of this event should be investigated (by a detailed check-up), in order to evaluate the risk for future strokes and start the proper therapy to prevent this. Hope to have been helpful!

This looks like a transient ischemic attack, a lesion due to reduced blood supply to the brain with spontaneous recovery. This might require a critical review of the family history, heart disease history, any notion of loss of consciousness in the past and epilepsy. It might be necessary to get a complete review from a cardiologist first, and neurological attention might be sought if necessary. Transient episodes of hypoglycemia could at times present as such and must also be borne in mind. It is compelling to a get a complete review by a cardiologist. Thanks and kind regards, Bain LE, MD."

Could you please tell me what test are necessary for me to be done on a regular basis. Kindly give me the details of the tests that needs to be done in future as well. Thanks inHello, I can understand your concerns and anxiety with a family history of cancer.  Routine screening procedures are different for specific cancers.  For breast, it starts with self-examination for lumps and mammography after 35 years. For cervical cancer, you can start getting a Pap smear every year now. For lung cancer, cast x-ray is being now evaluated for screening.  There are a few blood tests that can cover for markers of cancer as well. All these procedures are available for low cost. There are a little cancer that can be caused by defects in genes, and they are transmitted within the family. A whole body imaging procedure such as a PET scan can be helpful in such situations. From what you have mentioned, it doe snot look like to be the case with your family. Since PET scan is a costly procedure, I would suggest you reserve it for the last and not as a screening procedure.  You can get it done once some time in the course and later on follow up with other routine procedures described above. Please go for the simpler tests first. Hope this could be of help. Regards.",

I can understand your concern. Screening test for cervical cancer is pap smear examination.  It is just screening test.  Confirmatory test is cervical biopsy and histopathological examination.  If no conclusive diagnosis can be given on biopsy then IOC marker study is next option to confirm the diagnosis. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly.

            "i blacked out while driving.  i have no memory from after getting on the road up until, an officer tapping on my window.  then i was in the hospital, with the worst headache i have ever had and i was very nautious.  someone said they thought i was having a seizure.  anyway to know for sure?  all tests were clear.The problem with seizure is that the tests may all come out to be normal and yet you may have the condition. There is no absolute way of knowing positively whether you have had a seizure or not, unless it was observed by someone. The description of the seizure is the best way to diagnose it. Alternate way of testing for seizure, which you may have not done because it is infrequently found, is video EEG. Here you are monitored in a room for 24 hours or as per the protocol of the testing center. During this period, your EEG is recorded continuously. The chances of getting a finding are raised. However this may also be negative.I hope that answers you best of luck Chat Doctor. ",

My question is what could,be causing this???Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms and I appreciate the detailed description of symptoms provided by you. Based on that, the cause of seizures could be a structural lesion of brain. The location of lesion could be occipital region (located in the back of brain), in view of visual symptoms before the seizures.

However, I am concerned this may be related to something more serious.Involuntary movement of the eyelids for a short period with spontaneous resolution is most likely benign and commonly occurs due to myopia associated with fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, excessive working on computer screen, sometimes after excessive coffee (>4 cups /day) etc. As it appears self-limited, it is of little clinical consequence.

Read and understood your history of surgery for the skin tag 5 to 6 years ago at the same spot where you have hot a skin tag now. Only difference is there is a small lump under it. Recurrence of the lump at the same spot after so much indicates that there is some irritation, and it is most probably the bra strap that is rubbing over the same spot over yeas to cause a lump called as papilloma. I would advise you in such a case the following. Consult a General Surgeon to get a confirmed diagnosis and get the swelling excised for two reasons:One, you get rid of the lump which is not a normal part of the body. Secondly, you get a confirmed diagnosis by histopathology examination the nature of the lump. Change the bra in such a way that the new ones do not rub at all on the previous spots."

The symptoms you mention in query are pointing towards a condition known as muscle or mucus retention cyst.

I have been attributing it to that but am wondering if I should contact my internist/cardiologist for an appt.  Just had my yearly physical and ekg. 6 months ago and everything was normalGreetings! Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I carefully read your query. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. I would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but I am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. It would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with an atrial arrhythmia. And it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. My opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. However, if this is a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. Of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. As for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing a Chat Doctor.  There are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. If this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, I would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it.

            "I as told about 20 years ago that I have mitroprolapse valve. My mother had it and so do other members of my family. When I have a stressful day it really acts up. I had a heart monitor on yesterday and of course it was settled down and didn t do much. They took it off today and of course now it s really palpitating. And it makes me tired and makes me fell like I have to take deep breaths. Will some activity show even though it wasn t acting up. And if not should I ask for a different testHi, Mitral valve prolapse is a genetic disorder involving the Mitral valve. Treatment depends upon the severity of Mitral Regurgitation (leaking of the valve) and symptoms. If regurgitation is severe and the patient has symptoms, surgery (mitral valve repair) is indicated otherwise medical management is enough. Hope I have answered your query.

There are several factors (environmental- excessive smoking, alcohol intake, excessive sun exposure, fatty diet, dye exposure, industrial wastage). Hereditary-runs in families.

            "I saw the post from the mom of a child with a 12p12.1 deletion and was intrigued. I too have a son 9 y.o. who has been diagnosed with a 12p12.1 deletion and cerebral palsy. The geneticists at a top children s hospital had no experience with 12p12.1 deletion and could only find two other cases in the world in the medical journals. The geneticists nor the neurologist could tell us what to expect. The two cases found in the medical journal were apparently much more severe. My son has mild developmental delay, mild speech and motor delays, vision issues and has recently developed a movement disorder. He is able to run and play and is served under an IEP in the inclusion classroom to address reading, writing and math delays. I have done internet research and am concerned that I see genes in that region associated with cancer. Could this increase the likelihood of him developing cancer. Also, With the diagnosis of 12p12.1 deletion, would there not be another chromosome 12 (since they occur in pairs) that would contain the genes that are missing.Hello, Having a genetic deletion does not automatically increase the risk of cancer. Cancer is always multifactorial and genetics is a certain risk factor. Chromosome occurs in pairs. But sometimes gene requires two copies for normal expression to be produced. So one chromosome has deletion, end product won't be there. As there is limited knowledge in present deletion, not much can be commented upon. Now about risk of cancer - what cancer are we talking about. If we check ourselves, we would have plenty of mutated gene causing us high risk. As it has a multifactorial cause, cancer risk would be the same as most of us. However, better nutrition and healthy habits can still further reduce the risk. Hope I have answered your query. Happy to help, if you have any further queries.PS. Facebook seems to have a 12p mutation group - join and share informational care",

We just took her to a pediatric Cardiologist where they are now saying all 4 chambers of her heart had been leaking and that 3 of them were healing on their own but that the valve on the right side was still leaking so they want to put her on a monitor for 30 days to I guess find out what she is doing when the pain starts in her chest. Is this a bad sign for my grandchild? Does this mean that her heart is bad or that her problems could be fetal? I am so WORRIED about our granddaughter! Please could someone explain to me about the monitor & what to expect in the future for our grandchild! Thank you so much for any help! A worried GrandmotherHi... your granddaughter if correctly diagnosed with Kawasaki disease . Can be treated with medicines. The valve leak ... called regurgitation . Is usually mild and self resolving in most cases.

There were low levels of IL-2,4,6 that leads to the cytotoxic CMI leading to low levels of B-cell.You need to comment on these result in a scientific fashion giving clear answer supported by facts.Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. B-cells are white blood cells present in the blood which are responsible for humoral response of the body to any infection. Humoral response is the production of antibodies which are specific to the pathogen causing infection and these antibodies attach themselves to the pathogen causing its death. Antibodies are usually immunoglobulins (IG). There are 5 types of Immunoglobulins in our body. Egg, IGA, IGM, IGE and ID. If there is a B-cell deficiency, there will be low levels of Immunoglobulins produced.IL-2, 4 and 6 are factors which are called cytokines which modulate the cell differentiation and hence affect the cell mediated immunity. Deficiency of these factors may cause depletion of both B cells and T cells. Thanks",

Age, Ovarian reserve, hormones, like thyroid, prolactin, FSH, or uterine lining, this needs to be evaluated. It could also be due to stress, anxiety, change of lifestyle, or any medical conditions. Do you have any other symptoms like hot flushes, sweating, weight gain, weight loss, galactorrhoea? Proper evaluation is needed. I would advise you to visit a Gynecologist to rule out all the above factors. Hope this helps. Regards.",
            "hi my name is jackie from philippines, my menstrual period stop for almost 1year and 2months .. i alreadu go to my oby gyne  but still nothing happen.. my doctor said im not pregnant and he examin me by ultra sound and vagina scan they insert me a camera inside my vagina, he said my ovary is good. but almost year i dont have period, he gave me medicine Provera that i will take 2 time a day for 1 week, and he tell me to wait until 2weeks.. but almost 2months my last check up until now im still not bleeding or having period.. im so worry coz i dont know what happening to me and its possible that i easy get pregnant? im afraid having sex now maybe i get pregnant .. pls help meHello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion there are many cases for absence of periods other than pregnancy like thyroid abnormalities, polycystic ovarian disease(POD), anaemia etc. As the ultrasound is normal the POD is ruled out. Kindly get a thyroid profile done to rule out thyroid abnormalities.Also, the hormone levels like LH and FSH are helpful in knowing the cause for absence of periods. Also get HE done to rule out anemia. Nothing to worry. Once the cause is treated the cycles become regular. If the estrogen is normal the progesterone hormone tablets help in inducing the menstruation. If there is no response with progesterone tablets then the problem might at higher level rather than at ovaries level. Hope this helps. Best regards...",
            "my wife is confused if she is pregnant or not, we took 5 pregnancy test they came out positive and she haven t had a period in 12 weeks but when we went to the hospital she took a urine test and they told her that she was pregnant. but still no periodsHello dear, I understand your concern. Usually there is absence of menstruation during pregnancy. Every month the egg or ovum is released and uterus prepares itself for implantation of embryo. If the fertilization doesn't occur the egg degenerates and the uterine lining is shed as menstrual blood. In case if the fertilization occurs the pregnancy results and there will be no periods during the span of pregnancy. After delivery the breastfeeding due to prolactin hormone prevents the period for 3-6 months. So the absence of periods during pregnancy is absolutely normal. Hope this helps. Best regards ...",

In my opinion the irregular periods can be due to various reasons like POD, thyroid abnormalities, stress,overweight, obesity etc. As the pregnancy test is negative all the above causes should be ruled out. Ultrasound and thyroid profile need to be done. If overweight or obesity weight reduction helps in regularization of cycles. Avoid stress if any.Don't worry. They will become regular once the cause is treated. Best regards..."

When I try to either straighten or to bend it feels like it gets stuck and the two parts of the knuckle are rubbing against each other. When it finally moves it is very uncomfortable.Trigger finger. Tendon usually glides easily through the tissue that covers it (called a sheath) because of a lubricating membrane surrounding the joint called the synovial. Sometimes a tendon may become inflamed and swollen. When this happens, bending the finger can pull the inflamed tendon through a narrowed tendon sheath, making it snap or pop and it some feels like locking. This can be caused by a repeated movement or forceful use of finger. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and diabetes also can cause trigger finger. So can grasp something, such as a power tool, with a firm grip for a long time.",

            "I have had a mole since I was young. But recently I noticed that it has grown a little bigger. It is not round, and it is multi-colored . I am nervous that it may be skin cancer. I think I remember it being like this when i was younger as well, but I am really nervous about it being cancer.Hi, Thanks for writing in. A mole is an area in the skin surface where there is an excess of pigment deposition. Our skin gets its color from melanin pigment present in the skin. In a dark skin person, there is a higher quantity of melanin produced by the cells on the skin surface. In a light colored person, the melanin produced by skin cells is less. When the melanin is secreted in higher quantity in a particular spot on the skin surface, this gives rise to a mole and there can also be associated increased cell growth. The multicolor nature in a mole is due to the variable concentration of pigments in it. A mole is benign in most cases. However, if it develops sudden increase in size, appearance of hair on surface or pain sensation and ulcer formation then you should consult your doctor immediately. They will scrape the cells from mole surface if required and then confirm if it is a concern. Please do not worry.",

Common causes for having dark pigmentation under the eye are:-Iron deficiency anemia-Stress, anxiety or depression-Lack of sleep, poor sleep hygiene-Poor water intake-Smoking and alcohol -Chronic illness-Unknown causes (idiopathic). So, it is important to identify specific and treatable cause for best result.

General treatment consists of:-Iron and B complex vitamins-Apply almond oil around eyes in night-Put slices of cucumber above your eyes daily for 15 minutes-For stress (if present): daily morning walk, meditation and yoga-Proper sleep for 7 to 8 hrs per day, follow sleep hygiene-Plenty of water, fresh fruits, vegetables and salads intake-Using sunscreens: if your skin is sensitive for sunlight If above steps failed (which is less likely), then you should visit dermatologist for treatment options like: Medicines, Chemical peeling and Laser treatment.

            "Hi, Im 13 and have a pale complexion, my under eyes are very dark and sunken in!

Is there any creams out there that could help my problem? Im just starting out teen years so surgery really isnt an option for me right now, being Im so young. But the appearance of the sunken in eyes are obvious. They make me look so tired! Any help; tips will be very much appreciated.Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your concern and I have understood it. Dark circles can be quite difficult to treat. Hereditary seems to play a significant role. In allergy prone individuals, a condition or state of atop exists & these atomic individuals more often than not manifest with dark circles under the eyes. It also depends a lot on your lifestyle pattern-diet, sleep, computer / TV use and stress. Stressors/ Strain due to working for long hours on computers & lack of sleep play a major role tooth under eye skin is also a factor in causing dark circles, the thin skin makes the blood vessels under the skin very prominent and hence this appears dark. You could benefit from using a cream containing vitamin K and Retinol(EGA cream). Use it once a day for at least 3 months to notice a difference. Another important cause of underage dark circles is Iron deficiency Anemia. As can be judged from some reasons cited, good HY Chat Doctor. ",

Thanks,.Hello dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor.I have read your query and understood your concern. Dark circles is relatively a refractory condition. It takes really a long time before it shows good response to treatment. It may be due to familial causes, inadequate sleep, anemia, strain on eyes etc. In your cases, multiple factors are implicated. I will advise you to use safer segmenting creams around eyes like those containing comic acid, albumin, licorice etc. (like radiant i /under eye cream)I hope it helps.

Dark circles under eyes or under eye pigmentation is a challenging condition to treat. Its seen commonly in people having stressful life and irregular sleep and diet. It's also seen among people having atomic dermatitis and asthma. Sometimes its genetic due to deep sunken eye sockets in skull. Most of the OTC products are not very useful.

            "Hello, thank you for your help! I am a generally healthy 19 year old male with a height of 6 0 and a weight of 145. I have been a cross-country runner for over 5 years, and have remained physically active into my college years. My diet reflects that of typical American teenager; however, it may be slightly healthier considering the fact that the only beverage I drink is water and I generally try to be conscious of my diet (less processed foods, balanced, etc...) I am concerned about my blood pressure. Two years ago I had my blood pressure checked, on multiple occasions, at 142/90. Yesterday I had it checked at 143/88. And today, at my town s clinic I had it checked at 138/88, although I was exceptionally clam today because I am on vacation. This is highly concerning to me because I believe that my blood pressure would be even higher while in classes. In college, I often consume caffeine (about 100mg daily) and occasionally (1X/week) take stronger stimulants such as nicotine, provigil or methylphenidate, although I do not have a diagnosis of ADHD or narcolepsy. I do this to accommodate my work schedule as I am enrolled in a highly demanding elite university. I know that I have a family history of hypertension; however, none of my known family members have had hypertension at such an early age. In fact, I had my blood pressure checked alongside my 71 year old grandfather and his proved to be lower than mine (141/86). I love life and I cherish the experiences that I am able to have as an average American Joe. I am interested in prolonging my life for as long as possible, and I take this threat to my health very seriously. I haven t yet tried drastically lowering my salt intake, and I am reluctant to abate my stimulant usage, however I am certainly willing to to protect my health. I feel as though I already exercise enough, and it is quite difficult for me to permanently lower my cortisol levels. I also take my sleep habits very seriously and nearly always sleep 8-9 hours/day during the same relative time such that I maintain a stable circadian rhythm. This is why I am really at a loss as to what to do. My home clinician didn t seem to take this issue very seriously and he just told me that I shouldn t be worried and that he would check it again in a couple of months; however, I want to be taking actions to lower my blood pressure now! What do you recommend? Is this issue as serious as I am taking it? If so, what steps may I take? Is it inevitable that I will have to be prescribed a medication? Thank-you for your time! I look forward to hearing your valuable opinion.Hi, if your blood pressure is high on successive occasion then u will check your blood pressure three times in week on one day gap in between. If it is higher than normal than u have to first go for serum lipid profile with cortisol level. If it is normal than start antihypertensive tablet for some time than measure your blood pressure again if controlled than gradually decrease dose of Chat Doctor. ",

            "hi im cheerymeel from philippines, i just want to ask questions regarding with the condition of my mother who is diagnosed with endometrial cancer probably stage 2, our doctor told us to undergo my mom with chemotherapy before she proceed a surgical operation. is it right to undergo chemotherapy before she proceed with thw surgical operations?I am sorry to say that this is not the right treatment protocol for endometrial cancer. Normally, the first step in the treatment of endometrial cancer is surgery. If this we remove the uterus, both tubes, both ovaries, bilateral pelvic nodes and take a number of samples from various parts of the abdomen. We also take washings from the abdomen surface and send it for cytology testing. This is called a staging laparotomy as this not only is part of the treatment, it also gives the exact stage of the cancer. Depending on the final stage that comes after surgery, she may require postoperative radiotherapy. There is nor role of chemotherapy in endometrial cancer except in the last stage for palliation. You can visit nccn.org and see for yourself. I suggest you change your oncologist.",

I can understand your concern for your mothers' health. Stage II endometrial cancer is cancer of uterus that is confined to genital organs in pelvis. Treatment after surgery includes external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy boost to vaginal stump. External beam radiation is delivered to pelvis and brachytherapy is delivered via a cylinder inserted in vagina for a short duration as vaginal stump is at high risk of recurrence. This treatment brings down the chance of recurrence from 30% to below 10% at 5 years in stage II endometrial uterine cancer. I hope your query has been answered. You can discuss this with the treating oncologist. If you have any further questions I will be happy to answer. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.",

I just learned I have atypical cells in pelvic fluid and Dr. Is recommending chemo and radiation. Is this the most common treatment?Hi, Thanks for writing in to us. Endomentrial adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the inner lining of the uterus. This is treated by surgery in the initial stages. Some patients also require chemotherapy and radiation therapy for proper cure to take place. As you had surgery done and lymph nodes were negative therefore it is possible that the cancer was still localized to the uterus; however in some patients the biopsy of the specimen might show severe grade malignancy cells and this needs to be eradicated with chemotherapy and radiation. If you do not take chemotherapy and radiation then it is always possible that the disease spread might occur to other adjacent structures and then there will be metastasis even in the absence of primary tumor. Cancer must be treated sufficiently so that it does not return. Please do not worry.",

            "I saw the post from the mom of a child with a 12p12.1 deletion and was intrigued. I too have a son 9 y.o. who has been diagnosed with a 12p12.1 deletion and cerebral palsy. The geneticists at a top children s hospital had no experience with 12p12.1 deletion and could only find two other cases in the world in the medical journals. The geneticists nor the neurologist could tell us what to expect. The two cases found in the medical journal were apparently much more severe. My son has mild developmental delay, mild speech and motor delays, vision issues and has recently developed a movement disorder. He is able to run and play and is served under an IEP in the inclusion classroom to address reading, writing and math delays. I have done internet research and am concerned that I see genes in that region associated with cancer. Could this increase the likelihood of him developing cancer. Also, With the diagnosis of 12p12.1 deletion, would there not be another chromosome 12 (since they occur in pairs) that would contain the genes that are missing.Hello, Having a genetic deletion does not automatically increase the risk of cancer. Cancer is always multifactorial and genetics is a certain risk factor. Chromosome occurs in pairs. But sometimes gene requires two copies for normal expression to be produced. So one chromosome has deletion, end product won't be there. As there is limited knowledge in present deletion, not much can be commented upon. Now about risk of cancer - what cancer are we talking about. If we check ourselves, we would have plenty of mutated gene causing us high risk. As it has a multifactorial cause, cancer risk would be the same as most of us. However, better nutrition and healthy habits can still further reduce the risk. Hope I have answered your query. Happy to help, if you have any further queries.PS. Facebook seems to have a 12p mutation group - join and share informational care",

Till i never had bleeding. will this a big problem later? does placenta moves ? Can this problem create complications in delivery.Hello dear, i understand your concern. In my opinion placenta Pravda in early pregnancy might not be worrying thing. Because the placenta moves upwards in 90% of cases. But till that time you need to be careful like avoid lifting weights, intercourse,physical strain etc. Take strict bed rest. Regular ultrasound help in knowing the position of placenta.

In my opinion your placental position is normal in position. Usual position of placenta is in the upper segment of uterus i.e., high. Presence of low-lying placenta in early pregnancy is a normal finding seen in a few women. As the pregnancy progresses the placenta position gradually moves up. If the placenta doesn't move up and remain in low position it is called low-lying placenta or placenta Pravda. When there is low-lying placenta there might be bleeding during the pregnancy leading to fetal distress. As your placenta has come to normal position you need not worry. Hope this helps.

Let me first tell you that NEARLY EVERY PREGNANCY WILL HAVE PLACENTA IN THE LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT. Placenta is formed at 12 weeks of pregnancy. There is no much growth in placenta after that, only the baby grows, so also the uterus. In early pregnancy as the space in uterus is restricted, the placenta which is a sponge like discoid structure will have some part of it in the lower segment. As the baby grows, the uterus also grows & it will pull along with it the placenta up into the upper segment. This happens normally. It is a big blunder to advise a cesarean section for placental location based on scan in 20 weeks. Only placenta in patients with scar on uterus (like Previous cesarean scar or removal of fibroid or any other scars will not allow the placenta to go up. Am sure next scan at around 30-32 weeks will show the placenta in upper segment. You can then have a normal vaginal delivery Chat Doctor.

Placenta prefix is a condition when placenta is near / over internal OS (inner opening of uterus.  Type of delivery depends on how much placenta extends towards the internal OS.  - Low lying placenta/ placenta few cm. away for mos/ placenta covering margins of OS .have chances of normal delivery with expert management/ utmost care.

Treatment will depend on the cause of the pain. Hope this helps"

Feel glad that I am able to help you overcome your discomfort viz., soreness in ear lobes. My opinion after reading your query is that it is infection usually by bacteria of the tissue that surrounds and nourishes the cartilage(A tough, elastic, fibrous tissue) which makes up the outer ear.

Other possibility could be Ear Keloid(overgrowth of scar tissue that follow skin injuries) & many more possibility. Cant explain more. Best advise not only for your betterment but also to avoid further complication is that fix an appointment with a Family Doctor/General Physician/ENT surgeon/General Surgeon, who examine the ear & decide the treatment depending on severity viz., antibiotics/surgery followed by antibiotics. Sometime plastic surgery may be needed to restore the ear to its normal shape. Well, it all depends on severity.

Chat Doctor.  They are mild and non-sedative, and you can continue taking care of your twins effectively. Within few days you will feel better and will be able to have grip over your thoughts. Usually postpartum depression starts early after delivery, but it can be late in many cases; generally it can be a relapse of past depressive illness or a new illness itself. Reasons can be - altered chemicals and hormonal levels after delivery ; added emotional and work stress of newborns, etc. So, start medicines and get well. Hoep the reply is useful for you.

            "My Granddaughter had a baby girl on September 5, 2013.  The family (Grandmother, Great Grandmother and other relatives have been anxious to see the baby and her Mother.  She says she is too tired and too busy to see us.  She also has a 2 and a half year old daughter.  I feel that she may have some Post-partum depression.  Could this be possible considering what she is going through?Hi and thanks for the query, I am afraid she really does not present with the classical signs of postpartum depression. This should not be a worry at this point in time. Postpartum depression rarely has anything to do with affecting the relationship of the woman with her parents or immediate family. Isolation and feeling sad, failure to communicate and sleep disturbances are generally the commonest signs observed. In this case, it is difficult, and almost impossible, in my own opinion to think f postpartum depression. It might be interesting if you could move towards her where she leaves and works, or have someone persuade her you really need to see her and talk to her. I really do not think you need to worry for now. Feel good and kind regards. Bain LE. MD",

            "I m 16 wk pregnant and I have depression which is normally under control. However, my boyfriend is always stressing on me or upsetting me he also said something last night that I really cannot forgive. He doesnt seem to understand that this stress is inevitablly going to kick start my depression as its already having a debilitating effect on me. I have been extremely lucky not to have many pregnancy symptoms, however when he stresses me out I have jaw pain, neck pain, back ache, and severe headaches (think they are migraines) and this is all down to him stressing me which makes me freeze up, get no sleep and irritates my TMJ disorder, causing the headaches (I never got them befoore pregnancy-and I dont want them to stay!!!) I have spoke to him time & time again crying begging him to stop. This is not just a matter of oestrogen levels rising he s alsways been this way with me. What can I do? Should I avoid him till my baby is due? He is doing more harm than good. Is there any literature out there specifically for this problem-making him see that he cant keep doing this-he needs to get his stress out elsewhere & be more empathetic towards me. He isnt given me any emotional support Im scared about the effects of cortisol on the baby- it causes all sorts of problems- doubles risk of still birth & other social/mental/emotional& physical problems. He needs to stop or get out!!!!!Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  Healthy pregnancy demands good nutrition, good exercises, good medication & regular pregnancy check-ups, good & optimum exercises under expert guidance & a happy, positive & sound mind. Deviation of any factor directly affects fetus.  You have a psychological stress problem, specially with a particular person. The management of such stress requires efforts from both of you.  You start with your own efforts Start doing meditation/ mind concentration regularly Take help of some Yoga guru in your town & start practicing it. Along with exercises./ few sittings of psychological counselor would help./ Try to avoid points of dispute with the person.  Take boyfriend to your doctor/ family counselor. They will explain importance of psychological stability & positivity in pregnancy. They will also advise him few methods to avoid dispute / he may be given counseling.  Thus try wholeheartedly & both of you will bypass the conflict & a happy companionship.  In case, he is not responding, you can think of avoiding him till you get delivered.  Thanks."

It is normally treated with metformin/gluconate and weight loss for most persons. If the person does not wish to conceive then an oral contraceptive pill which can normalize the period is used, if the woman wishes to conceive then additional medication to assist ovulation (release of a normal ovum or egg) can be used. You should continue with the gluconate and if possible consider losing any excess weight, a loss of 7 to 10 % will help. If this by itself is not successful in helping you conceive, additional therapies would be used I hope this helps",

Last year my 3d mammogram was normal. My maternal genetics are not positive. Mother - survivor of a 66 yr. old procedure (radical mastectomy from lobular carcinoma diagnosis) and a sibling post menopausal with a insuiti (sp carcinoma) type of breast cancer requiring a lumpectomy with radiation and chemotherapy. Two maternal aunts succumbed to breast cancer (post menopausal ages) and a maternal aunt survivor with double mastectomy. Afraid, yes. I have my ultrasound tomorrow a.m. (Not a smoker, took birth control for 3-4 years in younger years..Drink alcohol responsibly,) Appreciate feedback.When a suspicious area is seen on mammogram, it needs to be examined either by fine needle aspiration or biopsy. These tests would give definite answer of cancer. Just by having strong family history you need not have cancer. Since the risk is more, you need regular screening and anything abnormal can be taken care of. Once advise is that need to stop taking alcohol since alcohol enhances cancer risk. Instead of worrying over family history, best would be to get rid of risky habits.",

            "Hello Doctor, I am Roma, 23, single and working. I come from a gujarathi family but born and brought up in Maharashtra. I am writing to you to seek help for my brother and parents. My brother and parents are having a strained relationship. Brother is 31, married and works in US. Parents (mom aged 55 and dad aged 59) stay in Dhule, Maharahtra. Dad is a physician (M.D., M.R.C.P.) and mom is a housewife. Brother has developed a feeling since childhood that no matter what he does, his parents are never happy with his achievements and they donot love him. He says that they have always pointed out only the negatives in him and never ever appreciated any of his poistives. He recalls many trivial incidents from his schoollife to graduation to current, wherein he thinks his parents never appreciated his success. Also he feels that MomDad try to micro-manage things ( as they want every small thing to happen as they want only) and donot appreciate independent thinking. (Though I know that mom dad have always been very proud of his achievements. It s just that their way of expression was way different from what brother expected). After his marraige, there have difference between his wife and parents. Parents feel that their son should take their side. But brother does not feel that right. Mom Dad are of a very traditional outlook. And this might be also because of the kind of society thet live in. They think they are always right. They think that after going to US and after marraige, their son has changed a lot. They think that their son is arrogant and not matured to the level expected. So now the case is Mom Dad are sad that their only son is being good to them inspite of they having been do so much for him all life. And brother is sad because he feels his parents have never been happy with him inspite of all his efforts and he is now frustated by their behavior/expectations. The situation is not at all good for a healthy family. I know i should not interfere in these conflicts as that would just tear me apart. But having know both the sides, feel a moral responsibilty to try to solve situations. Though they always all tell me not to worry about these things. Hence i want you to help them sort out things.Can u help here? The problem is brother is here for diwali right now and is going back to US on 10th of this month. So there is not much time. Would it be possible for you to have some phone-discussions and email conversations with all of them individually or on conference call? thanks RomaHello Roma, I agree that you face a very difficult situation within your family. Just to make the environment better, your parents as well your brother has to make efforts. Your parents should understand that their son is a grown UO now and has the capacity to take independent decisions. So they should try and not judge or interfere with him. On the other hand, your brother should also take pride in that his parents have worked for his success in life. They are his responsibility and he must work for their happiness. Hope the situation gets better. I would be pleased to help you further if I can in any way. Thanks.",

It will help all of your family member to resolve their conflict. So discuss with your wife and if possible separation is best option. Second cause of familial conflict is communication gape and some real events, so improve your in-family communication, but it needs active efforts from your side and understanding of family member and also needs time... first option is better if possible."

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more likely. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burping, chest pain, breathing difficulty etc. So avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Lose weight if you are obese. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

All came back negative for heart or lung issues. Dr diagnosed it as inflammation of the chest wall. I ve noticed that I keep burping and the pain occurs after a belch, even if I just drank water. Is this an important symptom that I need to share with my pcp since I m still having chest pains?Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease). Your symptoms of burping and belching are suggestive of HERD. Your cardiac and respiratory work up is also normal, so HERD is more likely in your case. GERD is due to laxity of the Gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these for HERD.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Take proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bed.",

In my opinion you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), as you are having upper chest tightness more after eating meals. So chances of HERD are more. GERD is due to laxity of the sphincter. Due to this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these for better control of HERD.1. Avoid heavy meals, instead take frequent small meals.2. Avoid hot and spicy food.3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Take proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6.

            "Last night i went to urgent care from what felt like the most severe burning inside my chest. They told me it was probably just heartburn and gave me some meds to keep my stomach from producing acid. Today I woke up with a different kind of pain in my chest. It feels constantly like pressure on my chest, and hurts to breathe deeply. The worst part is when I swallow. Water, food, too much saliva, and sometimes just randomly I get a terrible pain in my chest that makes it so I need to pause as it passes my sternum area. Please help.Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more likely. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of central burning chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in HERD. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily.4. Go for walking after meals. Lose weight if you are obese. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in your bed.6. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

            "i have shortness of breath and weak legs this has developed after I had a cold and seems to get worse my pulse has also increased from normal from 50s to 70s and at one time over 100 a few days ago. Is it bronchitis that will go away or should I go to the doctor?Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. The causes of dyspnea might be different. It might be a pulmonary problem, bronchitis, pneumonia BHT it also might be a cardiac problem. A viral infection sometime might affect the heart, her function, might affect pericardial layer and give pericardial effusion and this might be responsible for dyspnea, tachycardia. So, to clear all our doubt I will recommend you to have a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function, exclude pericardial effusion, a blood analyze and a thorax x-ray to see pulmonary situation. These will help to better understand what is going on and how to ménage it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor. ",
            "Doctor, I have had shortness of breath for two years. No one has found any reason why. I also have Hashimoto s Thyroiditis and Fibromyalgia. My D.O. found that I was anemic last year as well. He also found that I tested positive on an Anti-DNA test. He went on to test me for Anti-SM and Anti-Ro as well as for proteins in the urine. These three tests were negative. I kind of gave up on finding out what was wrong and just decided to live with it. However, I am concerned about the chronic shortness of breath as well as a new disturbing symptom. Two days ago, I woke up with severe lower back pain. It has not abated. I have made an appointment with my D.O, but it s not for another 3 weeks. I ve searched online and put the symptoms mentioned above through a Symptom Tracker. The thing that keeps coming up in response is Multiple Myeloma. This is really scaring me. I am only 43. I have two small children, ages 3 and 7. I do not want to have Multiple Myeloma. Also, The Anti-DNA result still means the jury is not out on Lupus, right? Could it be Lupus? Does Lupus cause lower back pain and Dyspnea? Does Lupus frequently occur with Multiple Myeloma? Do you think I might have Multiple Myeloma? Thanks, Andrea S.Dear Friend, Thanks for sharing your question. Following possibilities can explain your dyspnea: (1) Anemia (2) Lupus. Lupus can cause it by different mechanisms. You need to do X-Ray, Lung Function Test and HRCT to diff the same. Are u hypertensive also? There is nothing in your history (except backache) and investigations s/o Myeloma. You should also work up for other manifestations of Lupus. Hope I could add Chat Doctor. ",

When climbing stairs, if i think about it and breath its a lot easier, but usually my breathing is labored after a flight of stairs.Hi thanks for asking question. Your physical examination is necessary with auscultation. First rule out common condition for dyspnea that is anemia...PS examination with HE estimation done.... Second here dyspnea while staircase walk. So if any cardiac history or hypertension history present then ECG or echo done to rule out early stage of heart failure.... Thirdly if no cardiac cause then respiratory causes worked out by chest x-ray and pulmonary function test ... According to cause treatment done... If nothing found abnormal then psychogenic or panic attack by stress investigated.... Take care....",

Noted you are complaining you can't take full breath... Here you have some social issue also. So if you are taking excess stress then by panic attack such dyspnea can occur. So if you are taking stress try to avoid it. Regular exercise and yoga good for that. You can take behavioral therapy for it... Second if it is not stress related then I would suggest you to first get your respiratory examination from nose to larynx by rhinos copy and laryngoscopy ... Sometime this can be psychogenic cause. So for that psychiatric consultation done. Even if still cause not clear, to rule out restrictive disease pulmonary function test done... Hope your concern solved.... Chat Doctor. "

Based on your query, my opinion is1. Dizziness, fainting is usually caused by hypoglycemia or anemia.2. Hypoglycemia means Chat Doctor.  Get your blood sugar level checked.3.

I was diagnosed then with what they called Near Syncope and was told it would go away with age. Sure enough after the age of 19 it disapeared almost as quickly as it started. Now at the age of 26 its like it s back with a vengence only worse. I say worse because i don t pass out. Passing out made it better because i didn t remember the almost agonizing dizziness and i was almost fine after waking except for being very fatigued. Now...if i don t eat almost immediately when i think i should or feel just the tiniest bit of hunger...i get this rush of feeling hot, dizzy, very weak, and trouble focusing.

Help!Hi, Your symptoms are suggestive of a couple of different things that could be going on which involve the induction of what are known as vasovagal symptoms (with or without syncope or fainting) by a hypoglycemic state.  Or you may be experiencing diurnal excess secretions of insulin through over activation of your parasympathetic nervous system which should be investigated by a GI specialist.

            "Hey, I am a young male that recently turned 20, my question is about facial hair, my facial hair seems to be growing slowly and I am just worried that, like a few people I know will only grow in certain patches and stop there, how old until my beard is fully grown, will acne prevent hair from growing on that spot, does acne cream stop hair growth because of the chemicals in it, do acne scars without a doubt mean a bald spot for my beard in that scar area. At what age should I expect full growth, also, I think I have noticed my beard growing sligthly quicker when I exercice, this beeing from the raise in testosterone I assume right? I know my questions are a little all over the place, I would really appreciate an asnwer to all of themHi Many, Welcome and thanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor. So you are worried about the growth of facial hair (rather beards) in uniform manner. Now to solve your queries:1. Our growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time. It all depends on the family pattern and genes which we carry from our ancestors. So, basically it will be depending on your parents side.2. Neither acne nor acne scars and creams prevent the growth of hair. None of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general. But if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face.3. Yes due to exercise we do have a bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth. Lastly there is no medical treatment in this world which can cause growth of hair in only beard area and your questions are exactly the same which a young man have (and even I had when I was at your age) so don't worry and be happy.With the best health and beard wishes, Chat Doctor.

Skinlite cream is a prescription product for pigmentation/plasma over face. Skin lite cream contains a potent steroid, mometasone. It should never be used on face for long because a potent steroid like mometasone can cause the skin of face to become photosensitive, Acne ridden and thinned out with telangiectasias. Females can also have facial hair growth (Hirsutism) which is an additional problem. I would suggest that you stop using this cream. Once stopped the hair growth would resolve gradually, may take up to 3-6 months to resolve. Regards",

All these symtoms are now back but have had blood tests etc and no signs of infection. When I was admitted with sepsis all my bloods still showed no signs of infection. What should I do?Hi there, PID means pelvic inflammatory disease, and it could be the inflammation of the fallopian tube along with the uterus and also the inside of the abdominal cavity. Infection causes inflammation and when it heals with the help of antibiotics or on its own it leaves behind scarring or in this case adhesions which may occur between the different organs present in the lower pelvic region. These adhesions cause pain whenever the organs are moved due to having sex or any manipulation of the external genital organ. The bleeding post sex need s to be evaluated with the help of a PAP smear exam to rule out any cervical pathology. You may visit your gun and get yourself evaluated with the help of an ultrasound to rule out any other pathology. If there are adhesions they need to be freed which can usually be done microscopically or by open surgery if required. Do get yourself evaluated. Take care."

Am having Keloids on my chest, left leg near the knee and recently has developed on the back of my neck. I want to get rid of the same. Please adviceHi thanks for asking question in Chat Doctor. There are various options available for treatment of keloid. First treatment modality is intraluminal corticosteroid injection that is given once every 4 week. It is less painful and safe. Laser treatment also gaining popularity. But it is costly and several sessions needed for its removal.

Some surgeon using fluorouracil and steroid injection together to be injected. Silicone sheets also can be available, but it has variable result. Besides this main treatment modality some home base therapy also available like applying baking soda paste made with HY Chat Doctor. Lemon juice extract, aloe vera can be applied over it. Rose water.

They are not caused by steroid injections. There are certain factors which make someone prone to develop keloids like black race, dark pigmented skin, Asian race.

There are scar therapy methods to reduce the pain and sensitivity. Corticosteroid, laser treatments are used in this scar therapy.

            "my boyfriend told me yesteday that at the GUM clinic he had been told he had symptoms of chlamydia, I know i never gave it to him and he swears hes been faithful. i also found out that he has had it in the past, could this be why he has these problems now. PLEASE help this could make or break our relationshipHi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria chlamydia trachomas, and it easily spreads because it often causes no symptoms.  In fact, about 75% of infections in women and 50% in men are without symptoms. Hence, it may be unknowingly passed to sexual partners. Symptoms in men produced due to Chlamydia include the following:1. Small amounts of clear or cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis.2. Pain during urination.3. Burning and itching sensation around the opening of the penis.4. Pain and swelling of the testicles. The condition can be diagnosed by use a swab to take a sample from the urethra in men or from the cervix in women and then the specimen is sent to a laboratory to be analyzed. Treatment is by administration of oral antibiotics with azithromycin or doxycycline. It is recommended the partner(s) also be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread of the disease. It is very important that you always use condoms during sexual intercourse to lower your risk of contracting or passing on infections such as Chlamydia. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",
            "hi, I was reading information about Chlamydia and I saw that I have some of the symptoms...I don t want to go to the doctor because I m afraid...I want to know what happens if I take pills to control Chlamydia...what are the risks that I am exposed to?? thank youHI, thanks for using Chat Doctor There are antibiotics that can effectively treat chlamydia, your partner would also need to be treated. There should be at least a 7-day period of no sexual intercourse after the antibiotics are used to ensure there is no reinfection. All medications are associated with potential side effects, but risk associated with untreated chlamydia are more than those with medication. Side effects may or may not occur, most use with no problem at all. I hope this helps",
            "Hi I had chlamydia once last august and got tested positive the first time. Took medication and tested again but results came back positive. So took medication again and tested myself. Results came back negative. But after about 2 months got a pain in my left testicle and went into the clinic. They tested me again for sti/std s and said results came back negative . They said it could have been a bacterial infection that caused the pain in my testes. Now its been almost a year since all this happened but I am just worried if I should test myself again and not able to get peace of my kind. Any suggestion? Do you think I might have contracted other sti or std?Hi, Thanks for writing in. Chlamydia causes inflammation of the epididymis, a structure inside the scrotum (sack that holds the testicles) attached to the backside of the testis (testicles). Signs and symptoms include red, swollen and warm scrotum, testicle pain and tenderness which is usually on one side, painful urination, frequent urination, painful ejaculation, painful intercourse before ejaculation, lump in testicle, swollen inguinal nodes (lymph nodes in the groin), discharge from penis, and blood in the semen. If you have taken treatment and do not have any of the symptoms then there is no need to worry or get checked further. However, if you have any of the symptoms then additional check and treatments might be required.",

            "Case history:-72 years old patienta sizable intra-abdominal mass occupying the right hypochodrium. Ultrasonography and Ct scans gave the impression that the mass may be extrapancreatic or related to the uncinate process. The mass was also indenting the IVC but was not infiltrating it. He had no jaundice and was of reasonable body status. Guided FNAC was done and suggested undifferentiated adenocarcinoma as the pathology. Bearing in mind that there was a solitary liver lesion at segment VI, Limited exploration was performed with the hope that this lesion me be GIST tumour and the possibility of having the primary resected may help the patient. Unfortunately the tumour was found to be purely pancreatic invoving part of the head and encroaching on duodenal lumen and inseparable from IVC. In view of the previous findings only anterior gastrojujenostomy was performed to the patient to avoid future duodenal obstruction. His recovery was smooth apart from attacks of bilious vomiting probably related to the gastrojujenostomy. He has severe anorexia probaly related to his malignancy. He is now suffering from severe anorexia + cachixia+Regular vomiting (Fluid therapy is applied regularly)The surgeon is advising to perform another surgery to make a tube outside the body to give him food through it.  kINDLY GIVE THE ADVICE REGARDING THIS OPERATIONNB.Doctores did not decide to give him any kind of chemotherapyHello dear. I have gone through the details. Si it seems an unresectable pancreatic cancer with a suspicious liver lesion. Approach would be to do an FNAC of the liver lesion if it is metastasis then do palliative therapy. If no then do initial chemo or radio chemo to shrink the tumor and make it respectable. Since pancreatic tumors cause severe cathexis and loss of appetite and also patient is vomiting, it is a good approach to do a feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy to provide adequate nutrition. You can go for this operation. Rest of the approach I have mentioned. Hope it is clear. Thanks",

It is caused by infection by a parasite. The infection is detected by the examination of several stool samples over the course of a few days. More than one sample is needed because the parasite may not show up in a single sample. If you suspect this and live in an area where the infection is prevalent then you can consider sending samples to the lab for assessment. Colonoscopy however would be able to take a detailed look at the colon and determine if there are any other factors that may be causing your prolonged diarrhea such as inflammatory bowel disease.

Now, after 5 months of that i feel my neck is stiffed or some sounds in the neck when i move it, especially when it is cold. It can be connected to the concession that i had 5-6 moths ago? should i have a check up again? Especially what kind of check up and where, and what do you advice me to do? THANK YOU in advance.Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised along with MRI of cervical spine. As you are getting stiffness in the neck region and some sounds when you move the neck, it is related to the weakness of the muscles of the cervical region. Getting a Neuromuscular assessment of the cervical spine should help understand the cause. Also, with simple physical therapy and guided exercises for the neck muscles should give better results. In my clinical practice majority of patients having complaints of stiffness of neck region is due to weakness of the muscles of the neck and with physical therapy majority of them responds well.

This morning I woke up stiff and when I move my head up and down I have a shooting pain down the left side of my back.What should I do?Hi, I read your problem. Any injury to the neck like ligaments and muscle injury called sprain or strain leads to pain and stiffness over neck. A stiff and painful neck may be treated within a day, but firstly we will have to rule out that there is only muscle strain or sprain or any fracture? If the stiffness of neck doesn't subside within a week it needs medical treatment. But some treatments are:- REST - Take rest for one or two days so that the injured tissues of neck could be healed, which in turn will help to relieve the pain and stiffness of neck.- STRETCHING - The stretching will help to ease the stiffness and restore the movements of neck.- MEDICATIONS some medicines like ibuprofen and naproxen which are NSAIDs can be a first line treatment of neck stiffness and pain.- HOT AND COLD FOMENTATION - Cold therapy or ice packs can help to relieve neck stiffness. Applying the heat fomentation would increase the blood flow which leads to better healing environment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

If symptoms not improved please get an X-ray cervical spine then consult your physician. He will examine and treat you accordingly. Hope I have answered your query.  "

Thanks for posting your query on Chat Doctor! Many people do have similar craving for different substances, including ice. Medically we call it Pica. Pica is generally a symptom of anemia, either iron, zinc or Vitamin deficient. I would suggest you get a complete blood checkup done, to exclude anemia. If anemia is confirmed, treatment will range from a daily dose of supplementation, to blood transfusion, depending on your levels not anemia, then the craving could be related to another condition named obsessive compulsive disorder, in which the underlying emotional factors, if any, need to be ad Chat Doctor.

Which part of my body is touched with something, it start numbness on that place in a minute. I visited lots of doctors in different countries but they are unable to find the cause. If you please help me ?Thanks,AKMHello understand your concern. What you describe is called a paresthesia, an odd sensation when a particular area of your body is touched.  There are multiple causes of paresthesia, including neurological, vitamin deficiencies and even psychological. If you have seen many physicians already, I assume you had blood tests to check thyroid, B12 level, calcium level, magnesium level, iron level, as well as kidney and liver functions.  Some liver and kidney conditions could cause paresthesia. Also, some autoimmune diseases cause similar symptoms such as lupus or polymyalgia rheumatic. Next is to get electromyelograms with nerve conducting velocities of your arms or legs.  This will help identify any problem with your nerves or muscles. Some types of naturopathies cause parasomnias.  Do you have any medical conditions or are you on any medications that could cause these symptoms? The causes as you can see are varied. You can also see a pain management specialist who can help with the paresthesia. I hope you feel better",
            "I get full body paresthesia when lying down after around 45 minutes. Mainly during sleep. It wakes me up at around 4 in the morning. It goes almost instantly when I get up. The paresthesia can be removed from a part of the body - say the torso - by rubbing it. It then increases it in other parts of the body. I can progressively isolate it simply to the hands, Rubbing the hands together will remove it altogether for around 5 to 10 seconds but then returns usually back to the hands but sometimes back to other areas of the body. It cannot be removed totally without getting up. It s often accompanied with mild tinnitus which also only occurs when lying flat. Have spoken with 3 GPs a cardiac specialist (referred by a GP) and no one has a clue of the cause. I say paresthesia but there is no pain, no numbness - just a sort of high speed vibration and warmth inside the limbs.Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms seem to be caused by anxiety or a neurological disorder. I recommend you to consult with a neurologist for a careful physical examination. A nerve conduction study may be necessary to exclude a possible neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.

Thyroid hormone levels may be necessary to exclude a possible thyroid dysfunction, which can cause similar symptoms. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings! ",

Well while Bipolar disorder may develop in a person who has past history of anxiety and depressive disorders, but you should also take into account the fact that based on a single premise of mood swings one cannot be diagnosed as Bipolar disorder as there need to be a cluster of symptoms present together for formalization of this diagnosis. I am mentioning below some core symptoms and signs of Bipolar disorder which will help you to understand better about this condition.1) Elevated, expansive mood, also called as infectious gaiety.2) Inflated self-esteem and increase sense of self-worth.3) Overconfidence in one's abilities.4) Delusion of grandiosity and feeling superior over others.5) Over-familiarity and dis-inhibited behavior.6) Hyper-sexuality and promiscuity7) Decreased need for sleep (sleep only for 3 or fewer hours) but still one is able to get up with full energy8) Hyperactivity9) Flight of ideas and pressured speech that is ones ideas are produced in the mind at a fast rate so much so that ones speech is not able to complete one topic but before that jumps to another topic thereby making the speech incoherent and incomprehensible.10) Poor judgment and lack of insight, investment in doomed business ventures and going on spending sprees.11) Mood swings So you see you got to have few of these symptoms to be able to get diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, one single symptom does not support the diagnosis. I hope this helps. Regards",

After one month it developed to litter pain on shoulder to wake me up in the early morning. My doctor said that my thyroid function is normal because TSH 2, T4 0.85 . the vitamin d 28.9 little lower but I already took the vitamind3 2000iu more per day and my doctor said it is about enough vitamin d3 now but my problem even become more serious. I then went to emergency room because feel stress sex needed , short breath, and high blood pressure . Doctor want me bring all of the blood test result back to see my primary doctor. He did not say anything but no infection . I feel I am dying and no help because the following days is independent day and holiday. By overview my blood test I had found Sodium 135 (lower), Potassium (3.3) lower, Chloride95(lower), CO2 (25) normal, Anion Gap 15 (higher). I think I am lack of electrolyte, and buy the electrolyte concentrate to dilute with water to drink. After I drink a big cup of electrolyte water I feel much better no more stress. I continue my internet search about why short electrolyte and found that I need take more sea salt food and potassium food and I continue to search why Anion Gap higher. I had found my blood pressure medicine losartan may cause RTA and cause Anion Gap higher. After I take off my blood pressure medicine losartan and take amlodipine in stead of it , my shoulder pain disappear that night (My blood pressure medicine is amlodipine 5mg and losartan 50mg generally, now I change to take amlodipine 10 mg ). I had solved my shoulder pain but I still wake up in the early morning can not sleep enough. I think I might have Hypothyroid problem. By self-test of early morning 1st wake up temperature of my body , 95.2 F , 95.1F, 95.F. From the book if the body temperature in this self test is lower than 97F is hypothyroid. So I think now my problem is hypothyroid . I am looking for how to solve my condition. Thank you for reading and looking forward to your advice. fHiI would advise you don't study much on net as it would confuse you as a layman. Go to a physician with trust and get proper advise to follow. Electrolyte imbalances do occur time and again, so does body temp fall.97 is quite normal. Just eat routine diet and juices and fruits and take prescribed medicines. There is nothing to worry from medical point of view.

The Animal PAK supplement is a nutritional supplement used to increase nutrition in athletes and young people. It contains high dose of proteins, vitamins and amino acids which are to be taken cautiously in association with workouts. Animal PAK increases the endurance of the body and gives stamina to overcome short term energy needs.

In the long run these might predispose to serious health condition including cancer but confirmed reports are yet to be found in this matter. Please do not worry.",

You are right that some kidney conditions like stones or urinary infection might be the cause of back pain called in medical terminology as referred pain. Such pain characteristically radiates from back to groin along with associated symptoms like burning sensation while passing urine or fever. Further evaluation includes USG, urine tests. But pain due to vertebral conditions are dull pain often radiating to hip and legs. An MRI is needed for evaluation.

Back pain is a very frequent problem for which we need to do a basic evaluation.

You might have a herniated disc pressing the nerve and giving you this pain. Kidney pain is more in the costal area or the side of the back and will improve after antibiotics.

Pain in kidney area could be either due to spasm of back muscle or stone in kidney. Since you do not have any other urinary symptoms or hematuria or vomiting the possibility of pain is more likely to be due to muscle spasm.However, this has t be confirmed by clinical examination by a qualified urologist and doing ultrasound scanning OG abdomen and pelvis. Taking painkillers and antibiotic should resolve the issue. Further treatment will depend upon result of these tests and final diagnosis Chat Doctor. ",

            "Hi I am a girl age 22 , I am married from 1 year my husband s age is 33 , since we got married my husband is doing sex with a gap of 1 week or 2 sometimes 1 month, I want to ask why my husband is behaving like this? is there any psychological problem with him or what? while performing sex when he going to get discharge he suddenly pull out, i does not get satisfaction, is he weak or anxiety problem?  He also dnt want baby right now, I am really depressed, plz guide meHello, Normally couples married for one year have intercourse 2-3 times a week. But having less frequency does not point out towards any specific disorder especially when it is not associated with any problem with sexual performance (Erectile Dysfunction/ Premature Ejaculation) or other depressive/anxiety features (decreased interest in pleasurable activities/sadness of mood, hopelessness, death wishes).It's a possibility that he may be stressed out and not yet ready for kids therefore not going for intercourse. You need to talk to him and be open about your desires of sexual gratification so as you two can sort this out to resume your healthy sexual life. You may have to let him see the woman in you so as he should be attracted to you sexually more frequently. The reason for his lack of sexual desire if persists despite that may be depression, low testosterone (male sex hormone) levels, or other medical conditions such as diabetes or thyroid problem which decreases the libido. Since the reason for your depression is lack of sexual gratification by your husband, that is the treatment for you. If your depression persists, see a psychiatrist and get couple counseling. Hope the answer is helpful. Take care and feel free to ask queries. Regards.",

            "Urinate i hav a problem about urinate im always urinate 40times a days i already check up in doctor about this im 20 years old help me about my problemzHello Thank you for your question on the troublesome problem of urinary frequency. You don't mention that you suffer from any other related symptoms. But frequency can often be associated with urgency (a sudden need to pass urine) and difficulty in controlling the bladder to the degree that one may be incontinent. If you are troubled by these symptoms then I would recommend that you seek help from your GP or practice nurse. The bladder is emptied via the urethra by contraction of the normally relaxed detector muscle that constitutes the wall of the bladder. Lower urinary tract symptoms such as problems with frequency, urgency and getting up at night to pass urine are commonly related to an irritation bladder muscle (also known as detector instability). An unstable detector also contracts in between voiding. This causes high pressures in the bladder that may be felt as urgency and give rise to urine leakage. Rarely a deficiency of the hormone which controls the bodies water balance can result in urinary frequency and thirst. This is unlikely in your case because of the length of time you've had your symptoms, but again it is something your doctor can investigate. Thanks for using Chat Doctor forum"

            "In the past 6 months I have experienced bilateral hand pain and wrist pain. In addition, I have long term shoulder pain, jaw pain, and some knee pain. Rheumatologist said I had fibromyalgia, but i fear it is really rheumatoid arthritis. RF, CCP, ESR, LUPUS ARE NEGATIVE. slightly elevated CRP now and in the past. I feel lousy!! any thoughts? 63 yr old femaleHello, I can understand your concern. As your tests show negative for RF, ESR, CCP, Lupus, you do not have rheumatoid arthritis. I can describe you how you can differentiate between arthritis and fibromyalgia. Arthritis is a degenerative joint problem associated with the aging process. It is related with the bone pain. So if you think that the pain you have is increased while having joint movements or the joints make sounds while moving them, then you have osteoarthritis. Firbomyalgia is a disorder associated with muscles. Joints or bones are not involved in this pathology. In addition, this disorder is associated with sleep problems, excessive fatigue, and specific trigger points which will start or increase pain in the muscles. In addition, if you will stay inactive, sit in a place for a long time or after waking up from sleep, you will feel the joints are unable to move and then eventually it will improve. However, both diseases will require long term analgesics to control pain. You can visit a pain clinic or neurologist for alternate ways to manage pain. I hope this information helps.

            "I have been having a difficult time losing weight for the past 3 years. I have Hasimotos disease. I eat well and take many different supplements. In spite of that I havemild osteoporosis, a B12 deficiency and a vitamin D deficiency even though I take 4,000 units of late. I was recently diagnosed accidentally with a high homcystine level which make me concerned that all I do is not being absorbed. Could I have a digestice enzyme deficiency and a betaine deficiency. If so, what test should I have my doctor do.Hi, One of the causes of a raised homocysteine level is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Raised homocysteine levels are also a risk factor for diseases such as heart attack (medically called myocardial infarction), stroke etc. In fact a rise in homocysteine levels detects even early phases of Vitamin B12 deficiency. As you have been diagnosed with Hashimoto disease which is an immune mediated disease you may be prone to develop immune mediated diseases in other organs as well. An immune mediated disease is one where certain molecules called autoantibodies attacks its own cells and tissues. There is a possibility that you may have a condition called PERNICIOUS ANEMIA which is known to occur in some patients with Hashimoto. Pernicious anemia is a common cause of B12 deficiency. A protein called intrinsic factor, made by parietal cells that line the stomach, is needed for B12 absorption. In pernicious anemia, inflammation damages the parietal cells, leading to little or no intrinsic factor, thus preventing the intestines from absorbing B12. I would advise you to do the following tests Intrinsic factor antibody testParietal cell antibody testify any of these tests are positive then there is the possibility that you also have PERNICIOUS ANEMIA. In addition to this please also do a Fasting blood sugar and Post radial blood sugar test to detect Diabetes mellitus which may be associated with your condition. All of the above contribute to loss of weight and a feeling of exhaustion. You should also recheck your THYROID FUNCTION TESTS (TSH, T3 and T4). I presume that you may be taking medication for Hashimoto. You should take lifelong Vitamin B12 if you have Pernicious anemia. To correct the Vitamin B12 deficiency due to Pernicious anemia one of the methods is to take 1000 mcg I'm/SC injections once daily for 7 days, then weekly for 1 month, then monthly. There is also a nasal spray option:Nasal spray: 500 mcg (1 spray in 1 nostril) weekly.",

As per the history, you are suffering from recurrent Urinary Tract Infection, with raised infection parameters (TLC-24000/mm3 and ESR-40). Recurrent UTI can occur due to a number of different causes in males and females. Uncontrolled Diabetes is an important cause for both genders, hence it is advisable to get your blood sugar screened (fasting and post radial blood sugar). In elderly male patients prostatomegaly is an important cause, which can lead to recurrent UTI. In elderly female subjects, bladder neck obstruction (mainly age related) can cause raised residual urinary volume, which can again lead to recurrent UTI.

In depression low mood, crying spells, rejection sensitivity, inability to make close relationships are seen. I would advise you to please visit a good Psychiatrist for expert opinion. The symptoms can be treated by medicines as well as by Psychotherapies. Medicines like SSRI, SARI are mainly used in depressive disorders. Cognitive therapy is also a good option in cases of depression. So please visit a good Psychiatrist and take expert opinion. Thanks",
            "hi Ive had this sickness for roughly 3 weeks now and it mostly happens after eating its starts of with a tingling sensation running from my legs to my head and then i get either a hot or cold flush then i feel like im about to be sick but never am its a really uncomfortable feeling and Ive been to my doctors and they said it could be some sort of panic attack but im not so sure about that if you could help i would be so grateful.Hi there ~ It is not uncommon to have this feeling of hotness or feeling flush after a meal, particularly a spicy or a heavy or an unusually warm one.  Everyone's physiology is different.  However, if you feel that it is unusual for you and that it is causing you discomfort in any and every situation, I would recommend that you see an endocrinologist first since it could be hormonal.  If you have ruled this out, an unusual form of anxiety disorder may be the case.  However, you would need to consult a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation.  I hope this helps.

Was diagnosed improperly as asthmatic took short and long acting inhaled steroids for two weeks. I am off the inhalers, and currently use astepro and nasonex for indoor allergies. My lungs still feel inflamed- family history of GERD but have no overt symptoms of acid reflux, no family history of anxiety. I was hoping to get some feedback thanks.Hi, Welcome to the forum. It is nice to know that your investigations have a normal report. The symptoms of Asthma can be controlled and discomforts reduced, but there is no clear-cut cure of the ailment. It is important for you to take care of your lifestyle, quit any kind of addition as it may trigger your symptoms. Stay stress-free and have a good sleep.  It is caused by allergy of any kind, cold, pollen, food, etc. Some have a history of asthma as a family ailment. The people who are psychologically sensitive are affected by it. Asthma is a medical condition that results due to the inflammation, swelling or narrowing of the airways (bronchioles) in the lungs. It may cause over-production of mucus sometimes. IIT results in shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing. When the episodes of asthmatic attacks (coughing, shortness of breath, wheeze) get quite occasional, steroids, bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory medications and nasal sprays have to be taken (after consultation with your treating doctor).  Asthma is not a disease. A normal, active life should be lead. Have a good day, take care.",

Its NIDAANPARIVARJAN (in Sanskrit language) which literally means avoidance of the cause. Now, in many cases people are not able to change jobs or circumstances are such that they have to remain in such conditions. Here comes the principle of PRAANVAYU (richness of oxygen and fresh air) that is achieved by rhythms of deep breathing exercises called PRAANAYAM.

Milk allergy is may be due to milk protein intolerance or lactose intolerance. Individuals who are allergic to eggs, react to the proteins in egg whites. Every time the person eats an egg, the body thinks these proteins are harmful invaders. For both the allergen immune system responds by releasing histamine which causes an allergic reaction.

Plz reply as soon as possible..Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and here are the answers. Firstly, any unprotected intercourse during the safe period does not cause conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period in the cycle. So, if you happened to have the intercourse during the safe period, you are naturally protected. The intake of the emergency pill occurred during the stipulated time after the intercourse, so the protection offered is in the range of 98%. The pill can cause side effects like nausea, headaches, vomiting, breast tenderness and with Chat Doctor.  The next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year and get further help if you become overdue by ten days for your next period. Hope this helps."

The most common answer to the symptoms you are experiencing is Carpal Tunnel. It is compression of a main nerve in your hand that comes from repeated movement and compression of the wrist.

            "Hello approximately 6 years ago i had my first bout of Cellulitus (sp?) and ended up being hospitalized for 2 months . since that time I have had a numbr of additional bouts and sometimes end up in the hospital for shortr amounts of time or am fortunate to catch it at in time to be prescribed antibiotics and am able to stay at home while recouperating. A friend of mine who has also recently revealed that she has experienced Cellulius as well and has been treated with Ichthammoll ointment and hot and cold revulsion compression therapy to be healed. Can you tell me more about this later option...the Ichthammol ointment with the revulsion compression?Hi, Cold compression therapy is usually used to reduce pain, inflammation or after surgery. It works on the principal of rest & ice, compression & elevation to reduce pain. It reduces the temperature of the tissues thus reducing the metabolic rate.  Cold therapy is a combination of cryotherapy & static compression. Tissue at lower temperature reduces pain, inflammation & protects tissues from damage. Adjustable elastic wraps & other wraps are available in protective layers so that ice is not directly applied.  Application of hot & cold compression results in increased blood circulation & hence good health. Too much cold compression can lead to frostbite, so get connected with the PCP or physiotherapist.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

Should I go to ER? thank youDear Patient, Thank you for asking. Tremors can have wide spectrum of reasons. I do advice you to refer to a neurologist since a proper physical examination is very important. It can be due being generally tired and stressed can also be thyroid related or neural in origin indicating a more serious problem like Parkinson, but proper physical examination is needed. You would expect your doctor to order a blood test, and do MRI(brain scan), EEG (monitor brain electrical activity) and can prescribe tremor medications. I hope this helped guide you to what to do next and what to expect.",

            "I am taking two Curcumin tabs per day for osteoarthritis of the hips. I have been on them for about two weeks. I also take 4 panadol osteos, 7mls olive leaf extract, cerc, macuvision, lutein defence, COQ10, promensil, Metamucil, calcium, D3, B12. I have had a slight tremor in my left hand for about two years, in the last two weeks it has worsened and also has started in my left leg and right hand. Fine motor skills are slightly affected.

RobynHi A neurological consultation for tremor is better. The meds. Mentioned by you may or may not be a cause, still other causes of tremor have to be searched for. Cardiac arrhythmias may also indirectly cause varied symptoms if affecting circulation, ask your cardiologist too. Then there could be spinal causes due to cervical spondylosis.

My sleep apnea is being treated and my c-pap machine was just updated by the doctor with the amount of pressure he recommends. The shaking had started before this change, however.Hello ! I read carefully your question and understand your concern. I would like to know your age and if you have a family history for tremor. There are different causes of tremor. As far as I understand from your description, yours is an intentional tremor, which gets worse when you try to reach for the target. In a young patient I would think about a metabolic cause like hyperthyroidism. While in older patients I would think about essential tremor, a degenerative disease or a stroke. But the gradual beginning of your tremor rules out a possible stroke. A positive family history for tremor would be in favor of essential tremor diagnosis. Sleep apnea can cause tremor in the hands during the day, but it would improve with the good treatment of apnea. So I would recommend you to consult with the neurologist and have a full blood work and the thyroid function tests. A brain MRI may be helpful if the above tests result normal. Hope to have been of help! Greetings!"

            "recently almost every day,usually later in the day,my voice becomes very hoarse and scratchy.Im not sure why this is happening.I have not had a change of address or any colds or problems with ventilation in my home.A friend of mine was concerened ,they had cancer discovered when a Dr. noticed his voice was so ruff and hoarseHi, I am Chat Doctor.  The likelihood of your voice hoarseness being of cancerous origin is likely if you smoke, take lots of alcoholic spirits, have a family history of throat cancer, strain a lot with your voice or do oral sex (some strains of HPV virus which can be contracted from oral sex) can cause throat cancer. Otherwise, if you use your voice a lot (at work or somewhere else) especially lately, then you can have voice hoarseness without it being a cancer. Another cause may be the onset of a palsy of the nerve that innervates the voice box. It could also be onset of symptoms of a voice box muscle involvement of a myasthenia graves (or some other related muscle weakness disorder) which often worsens with time of the day. Please see a physician for thorough examination and proper work-up in order to determine the cause. Courage and wish you the best, ",

The pain is now unbearable in my back and the last few days have experienced pains running down the tops of my arms. I am also starting to get the same lung pain on the left.Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Hoarseness of voice with chest pain can be seen in many conditions, but the common causes are1. Lung malignancy2. Endobronchial tuberculosis3. Lung abscess4. Phoenix nerve palsy with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (vocal cord paralysis)So better to consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. CT thorax3. Bronchoscopic evaluation of vocal cords and trachea to rule out above-mentioned causes. Examination of vocal cords is very important in hoarseness of voice. Its movement, nodules on surface, ulcers etc. can be very informative to reach the diagnosis. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.",

Hoarseness in your voice could be due to an acute irritation of the larynx and trachea and vocal cords. It could be due to acute viral infection, or irritation of acidic liquid of stomach when you had the episodes of vomiting. It is better to get checked by ENT specialist to determine the right diagnosis. Keep good oral and throat hygiene. Gargle with warm water and salt. Take antihistamine orally until you see ENT specialist. Wish fast recovery.",

            "I am 28 weeks pregnant and have just been to doctor and my blood pressure was 150/90 and there was protein in my urine. They have taken blood and are ringin me back at 5pm with the results.  The doctor said I may have pre-eclampsia which would mean early labour.  I have got home and am now very anxious.  Would early labour mean now? Or jsut bed restHI, Thanks for the query under Chat Doctor.  I have read & understood your concern.  * Preeclampsia is a critical condition in pregnancy, which is liable to turn in Clamps which has risk for mother as well as baby. So once pre-eclampsia is noted, doctor tries his best to control the situation & avoid further complication.  But in case there is no response to palliative treatment. Delivery of the baby remains the only sure treatment to control blood pressure & avoid complications. Of course the decision induction/ LSCS is taken with balancing the fetal viability & possible risk.  * Apart from this pre-eclampsia itself can cause premature deliver .on its own.  ** So the possibility of early delivery can be guessed by the known course of the condition itself , & one has to be prepared to accept it, and try to control the symptoms & prolong delivery as far as possible.  Still, no control of blood pressure / albumin inspire of treatment ascertains early delivery.  Thanks.",

At 29 weeks It's still too early and the care of mother and baby are very important. The best treatment for pre-eclampsia is delivery, but at 29 week the babies' survival is a concern. We need to monitor the mothers health and the fetal condition in way of hourly BP monitoring, blood test, urine test, Fetal ultrasound and fetal Doppler and Fetal heart tracings in the form of NST. Diuretics have to be used very cautiously in pregnancy, and are avoided unless no alternative is available. If the maternal or fetal condition deteriorates at any point, it's best to consider deliver, in a hospital with good NICU back up. Hope this helps. Regards.",
            "Im 33 weeks pregnant and had a sudden spike in my blood pressure. It went to 170/110 but slowly went down throughout the day. Was feeling horrible (headache, anxious, very hot and flushed) during the spike and all symptoms except the headache have went away. All bloodwork came back normal except my liver function panel was a bit off. Awaiting 24 hr protein test results and am on bedrest until all tests come back. My BP s have stayed normal (110/78 range) since the spike. Is it possible to have preeclampsia with normal BP s, or is it possible to have random spikes that high and nothing be wrong?Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion there is no chance of preeclampsia with normal BP. Infact preeclampsia is a combination of high BP more than or equal to 140/90 along with proteinuria and with or without pathological swelling of feet. But at the same time presence of spikes of high BP might also cannot be considered as normal. Mild elevations up to 130/80 might be acceptable but not more than that. The BP should be recorded at 6 hours apart. If at both the instances the BP is high pregnancy induced hypertension(PIN) is said to be present. The presence of abnormal liver parameters, headache,high spikes of BP might suggest PIN .24 hour protein is helpful to diagnose if it is just PIN or preeclampsia. Avoid stress and relax. As there are medicines available which can control BP. Check your fetal movements and other symptoms of clamps like vomiting, epigastric pain, blurred vision, decreased urine output. These are called imminent signs of clamps. Eclampsia is a condition where preeclampsia is superimposed by fits. Take high protein diet and relax. You might not go up to that clamps level but just I am giving you the information. Hope this helps. Best regards.",

My question is how high can it get before it gets really dangerous for her or the baby? I don t understand why she has hasn t been induced yet.Hi there, Toxemia of pregnancy or severe pre-eclampsia is a very worrisome condition and the blood pressure you have mentioned are very high. The life of your friend is at risk at such high pressure, and she can get a convulsion/fit, bleeding, kidney failure at any time. She needs to be taken care in an Intensive Care unit and monitoring of the condition and medication to control the blood pressure should be given. She will also require an injection Magnesium Sulfate intravenous Chat Doctor. Yes delivery will definitely improve her situation as the cause of high pressure is the pregnancy. But whether induction of labor or cesarean section will have to be decided based on her previous delivery, her general condition and the likelihood of successful vaginal delivery if induced. It would help me to guide you better if you would tell me how many weeks pregnant she is currently. Hope this helps. Regards."

Wear a good ankle and lower leg brace that will keep the Achilles tendon immobilized, and prevent a limp. Also do lower leg calf muscle strengthening exercises every day.
