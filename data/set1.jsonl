He values their wisdom and seeks their counsel. They, in turn, respect him and respond when he calls upon them."

He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard’s creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the HalfBlood Princes book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone.

What does Harry notice on the map that seems odd?Something odd catches Harry's attention on the Marauder's Map, prompting him to investigate further.",
        "‘Cheers,’ said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolledup socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.

        " As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the HalfBlood Prince.

Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape’s homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their afterlunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape’s.

        "“It's been a massive organizational problem,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry's been working on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can't have too many clogging up their buses and trains - remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there's a handy wood they're using as the Apparition point. For those who don't want to Apparate, or can't, we use Portkeys. They're objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that's where we're headed.” How does the Ministry handle transportation for wizards attending the World Cup?They use a combination of Apparition, Muggle transport, and Portkeys to bring attendees to the event location.",

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.

How does Professor Binns react to the students' reaction?Professor Binns looks annoyed at the students' continued interest in the story, likely because he finds their reactions disruptive to his usual teaching style.",

I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!” What task is given to the students in the passage?They are instructed to attempt making the Draught of Living Death within an hour in Advanced Potion Making.",
        "“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.” What does the author mean when he says 'the true master does not seek to run away from Death'?The author suggests that someone who truly understands death accepts it as a natural part of life and doesn't try to evade it. Instead, they understand that there are greater dangers in the living world than the fear of death itself."

        "They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn’t been her fault at all, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone else’s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks’s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them. How has Tonks changed since last year?Last year, Tonks was inquisitive and lighthearted, but now she seems older, more serious, and purposeful. This change may be due to the events at the Ministry.",
        "As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light’s oft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's exclamation. How does Mrs. Tonks appear differently when not transformed?Mrs. Tonks looks significantly different when not transformed into a werewolf. Her hair is lighter and her eyes are wider and kinder, making her resemble her sister Bellatrix less haughtily.",
        "Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled. Why does Tonks disappear after entering the yard?Tonks is a Metamorphmagus, able to change her shape at will. She disappears to avoid being detected by non-magical eyes.",
        "“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousyhaired and miserablelookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. “I can fix your nose if you stand still.” What is Tonks' appearance like before fixing Harry's nose?Tonks is described as mousy-haired and miserable-looking before fixing Harry's nose."

        "“While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible partlife to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see … or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number . . .’ Isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a sevenpart soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.” What is a key characteristic of the people in the passage?Mr. and Mrs. Lovegood are described as eccentric collectors who value rare objects.",
        "'Well, my dad is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!' said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head. 'He's always saying he'd believe anything of Fudge; I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him. And then there's his Umgubular Slashkilter —' What can we infer about Mr. and Mrs. Lovegood's stance towards the Ministry of Magic?From the passage, it appears that Mr. Lovegood supports anti-Ministry actions and believes Minister Fudge's lies. He also uses the Department of Mysteries to develop poison against those who disagree with him.",
        "“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.” What effect did the pressure have on Old Lovegood's behavior?Old Lovegood's behavior was influenced by the pressure he was under. He may have revealed the truth or his version of the truth to keep the conversation going."

It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place.

Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak - and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him -“ What led Dumbledore to realize it was a trap?He heard footsteps running up the stairs and immobilized Harry before Malfoy entered the room, suggesting an ambush.",
        "Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle’s shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall. What were Malfoy and his teammates wearing when they were found?Malfoy and his teammates were found lying in long, black, hooded robes after losing the Quidditch match.",
        "Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely. He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy entered the room, closely followed by Snape. What is the significance of Draco Malfoy's entrance?Draco Malfoy's entrance indicates that important characters are present in the scene, suggesting that significant events may occur.",

MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!” What is the immediate consequence of the attack?The attack results in Malfoy being seriously injured and lying in a pool of his own blood."

Who is Grawp and what is mentioned about his previous encounter with Harry?Grawp is described as Hagrid's halfbrother and a vicious giant. In their previous encounter, Harry found it difficult to communicate with him due to his limited vocabulary.",
        "Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes, small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half-gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility. What are some physical characteristics of Grawp?Grawp has a huge face that resembles a grey full moon, a nose that is stubby and shapeless, a mouth that is lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks, and eyes that are small by giant standards and half-gummed together with sleep. He also has large knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball.",
        "But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them, Harry, Hermione and the filty or so centaurs filling the clearing, looked around. Harry's centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows. Hermione had been dropped, too, and Harry hurried towards her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap. How does the appearance of Grawp affect the scene?The entrance of Grawp, a giant, creates a significant shift in the scene, as it interrupts the conversation between Harry, Hermione, and their centaur companions and demands their attention.",
        "There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water. What can we infer about the size and strength of Grawp?From the description, it can be inferred that Grawp is a very large and powerful figure who inspires fear in the crowd."

All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores – goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!” Who might Rita Skeeter's 'important source' be?Rita Skeeter's 'important source' could potentially be Bathilda Bagshot, given Muriel's belief that she may have shared information with Rita during the Ariana business.",
        "Rita Skeeter's smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know. Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it. Would you call him a father substitute?” What does Rita Skeeter plan to do after asking the question?After asking Harry about Hagrid, Rita Skeeter plans to write an article using her Quick-Quotes Quill.",

People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you know – he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.” Who is Skeeter and what does she claim to have access to?Skeeter is a journalist who claims to have accessed a new and previously unheard source about Dumbledore's past. This source is someone who was close to him during his most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.",
        "“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!” Why is it dishonorable for Rita Skeeter to have taken advantage of Bathilda Bagshot?According to Mr. and Mrs. Doge, it is dishonorable for Rita Skeeter to have exploited Bathilda Bagshot by using her words without her consent. This implies a breach of trust and privacy."

One of Fudge's hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was captioned: How Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts? Who is depicted in the cartoon on the magazine cover?Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, is shown in a cartoon on the magazine cover, wearing his lime-green bowler hat and holding a bag of gold while choking a goblin.",
        "Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach – he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic himself. Who did Harry encounter unexpectedly?Harry encountered Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, who was not expected to be present.",
        "“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his chin, “but we’ve never found him. If you ask me, he’s not dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s Black we ought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don’t see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.” What does Cornelius Fudge believe about Voldemort?Cornelius Fudge believes that Voldemort is not dangerous unless he has support. He is more concerned about Sirius Black."

It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind. What is the relief for students when they go to Herbology class?Students find relief while attending Herbology classes as they are allowed to swear loudly when handling dangerous plants, unlike in other classes where they need to practice nonverbal spells.",
        "A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn’t seem to be working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. He couldn’t see whether Justin was among them. He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section. What are the Hufflepuffs doing in the library?They aren't studying Herbology as they should be; instead, they're engaged in a deep conversation."

Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.

        "At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago.…All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, “Expelliarmus”…and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned…the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse - and Voldemort was right - his mother was not here to die for him this time.…He was quite unprotected.… What spell did Harry learn at the dueling club?Harry learned the Disarming Spell, 'Expelliarmus', at the dueling club.",

Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!” How could Harry's reliance on Expelliarmus potentially put him at a disadvantage?If Harry becomes too predictable by relying heavily on Expelliarmus, his enemies could learn to counteract it, making the spell less effective. Lupin advises Harry to diversify his magical abilities to maintain an element of surprise.",
        "Percy said, “As a school prefect —” but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, “Expelliarmus!” and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it. How does Harry react when Percy tries to intervene?Harry loses his temper and uses Expelliarmus to disarm Malfoy instead of listening to Percy."

The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.” What is the consequence of drinking unicorn blood according to Firenze?Drinking unicorn blood keeps you alive even when you are inches from death, but it comes at a terrible price: a cursed life with only half-living.",

Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any - and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now- take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act - and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!” Why is Cornelius Fudge's focus on 'purity of blood' problematic according to Dumbledore?Dumbledore argues that Cornelius Fudge places too much emphasis on 'purity of blood', failing to recognize that what truly matters is what an individual grows to be rather than their lineage.",

Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: “Crucio - Crucio - you can’t dance forever, pretty-“ What is Ginny doing during the battle?Ginny is engaged in a fierce battle with a Death Eater named Amycus.",

All those closest to Albus – and I count myself one of that lucky number – agree that Ariana's death, and Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. How did Ariana's death affect Albus?Ariana's death had a profound impact on Albus, leaving a lasting mark on him. He felt a deep sense of personal responsibility, despite being guiltless."

However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus's shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. Why does the author describe Aberforth and Albus as different but friends?The author explains that although they are different, they still get along well and Aberforth's experience of living in Albus's shadow is not easy but not unpleasant."

Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became Moody's double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody's clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.” Why does the author emphasize the importance of the Polyjuice Potion in this scene?The Polyjuice Potion allows Barty Crouch Jr. to transform into Mad-Eye Moody, enabling him to infiltrate Hogwarts undetected and gather information for Voldemort.",

The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with Harry’s ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: a trussed-up Father Christmas. How is the man described in the passage?He is described as having white hair and a thick, bushy beard. He is also upside down and bound invisibly."

There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed. How does Professor Binns react to the students' reaction?Professor Binns looks annoyed at the students' continued interest in the story, likely because he finds their reactions disruptive to his usual teaching style.",

If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.” What does the author mean when he says 'the true master does not seek to run away from Death'?The author suggests that someone who truly understands death accepts it as a natural part of life and doesn't try to evade it.

Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible partlife to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see … or as close to immortal as any man can be.
